&gt; https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/jan/02/blog-posting/obama-2013-and-trump-2018-are-shutdowns-same/

&gt; First, leading Republicans, including Ryan, noted that Obamacare largely would move forward even if some elements were defunded. In that sense, Obama was not fighting to ""force"" Obamacare, because he didn‚Äôt need to.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, in 2013, two issues, Obamacare and the debt ceiling, were on the table. In 2018, funding for the wall stands alone. In 2013, a compromise on the debt ceiling cleared the way to reopen the government.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a legal difference. In 2013, Obamacare was already law. Funding for the wall is not.
&gt; 
&gt; The situation in 2013 was more complicated than today. Obama, like Trump, aimed to protect a favored policy. But he also wanted to raise the debt limit, an issue of at least equal importance. "

First of all, I don't think Trump has a problem at all with Jews. I didn't imply nor do I believe that Trump is a true antisemite.

I just don't think he's the most ""pro-Jewish president in decades"". I'm separating that from the actions that he's taking for the government of Israel, which are purely political and not necessarily ""pro-Jewish"".

And the only reason his base is pro-Israel is because they stupidly believe in some cosmic war they are trying to bring about between god and ""the devil""."

Erica stated that she had been out for The Girl‚Äôs Night Out Celebration that was held at the Charleston Civic Center earlier that night and then her husband [redacted] decided to go out for more drinks afterward. Erica went on to say that they ended up at the Broadway bar on Leon Sullivan Way and ended up running into a co-worker (Chelsea Ambriz) of Erica‚Äôs. Erica advised that she had problems with Chelsea in the past as far as her being aggressive toward her. Erica said that her and her husband didn‚Äôt think anything of it until later in the evening Chelsea began to hit on Donald. Donald told Chelsea that he was not interested in her and went back over and stood with Erica. Donald mentioned to Erica about what had just happened with Chelsea and so Erica went and confronted Chelsea about it. Erica said that Chelsea then became irate and began to shove Erica causing both of them to fall over in the bar area.

&gt; Erica told me that her ear drum had been busted in her left ear which was causing it to bleed and a large knot on the side of her head. She advised me that she would be having a EKG scan done while at the hospital to see if there was anymore internal damage.

ani625,"&gt; Trump licensed the use of his name for the project and it was used in all of its marketing materials, but later claimed that he was not responsible for the development.
&gt; 
&gt; Units were pre-sold before construction began, generating US $32.5 million in revenues from buyers‚Äô deposits. However, none of the proceeds were reported to Mexican tax authorities.
&gt; 
&gt; Ground was broken for the development but in 2008 it was hit by financial problems and the following year it was shut down. Around 250 apartment buyers, most of them from southern California, lost their money.
&gt; 
&gt; Shortly after, nearly 70 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump, his children and the developer. They claimed that they were deceived into believing they were buying into a Trump project when Trump‚Äôs involvement apparently didn‚Äôt extend beyond the licensing of his name.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, Trump settled the lawsuit four years later although he denied any wrongdoing. The terms of the agreement were not made public.

ani625,"During World War II, Abraham Wald was a member of the Statistical Research Group (SRG) where he applied his statistical skills to various wartime problems. These included methods of sequential analysis and sampling inspection. One of the problems that the SRG worked on was to examine the distribution of damage to aircraft to provide advice on how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire. There was an inclination within the military to consider providing greater protection to parts that received more damage but Wald made the assumption that damage must be more uniformly distributed and that the aircraft that did return or show up in the samples were hit in the less vulnerable parts. Wald noted that the study only considered the aircraft that had survived their missions‚Äîthe bombers that had been shot down were not present for the damage assessment. The holes in the returning aircraft, then, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still return home safely. Wald proposed that the Navy instead reinforce the areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed, since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost."

He put fucking Betsy devos as education secretary. He's got scandals coming out his ass. He's fired a ton of cabinet members. He speaks at the level of a 4th grader. He pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. He insults football players instead of dealing with actual crises. He uses every incident as a Dick measuring contest. He may get us into a nuclear war with North Korea by running his mouth. He's insane, illogical, and a pathological liar. These are just what I think of off the top of my head.

I'm aware of /r/insanepeoplefacebook yes.

ani625,"How is Trump so consistently wrong on nearly every subject he chooses to comment on?

---

Because he has **[pathological splitting.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_\(psychology\))** You can see it in the context of the interview. Stern and Donald are talking, Stern mentions that OJ attended Donald's wedding, and Donald freewheels into a defense about how ""there wasn't ***that*** much blood"" inside OJ's car and how he could have been framed by ""any one of fifty people.""

It's bizarre to me how many people haven't picked up on what motivates Trump's behavior patterns considering that his pathologies are so deeply controlling. He literally can't help himself. If Donald perceives a person as an ally/friend/flatterer, then any attack or criticism of them he will treat as an attack on him to be vigorously denied no matter the truth or the stakes. Vice versa, if someone criticizes Donald, then Donald uncritically accepts and amplifies every criticism of that person he hears, and he also will refuse to grant even the slightest praise someone else offers of that person. 

You can see this over and over again in his behavior in public for the last two years. He went from being buddy buddy with Ted Cruz to yelling at a rally that Ted Cruz's dad killed JFK because he read it on some blog. All because Cruz went from bootlicker (and wannabe-slipstreamer) to open opponent. Or look at the Donald-O'Reilly interview: O'Reilly questions why Trump would play nice with Putin when Putin kills journalists; Trump's response: ""We got a lot of killers too."" 

 Once you figure Donald out, he's fucking 1D Settlers Of Catan. *I knew even without opening the article* that Donald would only have said OJ was framed because someone said 'You've hung around with OJ what's he like?' or some similar interview question. **He didn't say that shit because he believes it. He said it because he's got a broken brain that interprets the exterior world as an extension of his personhood.**

ani625,"&gt; President Karimov saw the rise of Islam in his country as a threat to his power and decided the only way to hold onto power would be to crush those overly devoted with an iron fist. As a result, more moderate and secular religious voices were silenced while the extremist end fought bitterly and survived, mostly underground. What this did was inherently make it so that the prime form of political opposition to Karimov‚Äôs regime was radical Muslims; thereby equating anti-authoritarianism with jihad.
&gt; 
The Uzbek government worked hard to ensure Islam would not threaten Karimov‚Äôs stranglehold; mosques became universally littered with police spies, speaking Arabic and growing a beard became an offense punishable by long stints in prison, devout Muslims were routinely harassed, etc. 

Now that's some good ol' traditional communism at work."

ani625,&gt; We are a ~~far-right~~ neo-nazi subreddit.
ani625,"Funny, yet sad at the same time."
ani625,"[Why so many cultural Christians stand up for Trump.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/75tl70/drop/do94wbd/?context=3)
&gt; 
&gt; It‚Äôs because through him they win. 
&gt; 
&gt; It‚Äôs not always about racism. I know some people really like to think two-thirds of the population spends all its time thinking about 12% of the population, but they don‚Äôt. Some are indeed racist and like all the signaling. But a lot of states are very strongly majority white and blacks really aren‚Äôt their concern 24/7. 
&gt; 
&gt; First thing is you have to understand that so-called Christianity in the US can‚Äôt be easily compared to Christianity in most other countries. Elsewhere Christians follow the Bible or the Pope or their patriarch. Here, the strongest written influence isn‚Äôt really scripture. Instead it‚Äôs a weird genre of books that‚Äôs a mashup of personal testimony, self-help and sales presentations. These writers are really famous and have huge followings. They talk about the mistakes they made and what God taught them and how they finally learned their lesson. You find the same types of stories in other media of course. Radio evangelists, televangelists, megs churches etc. They all promise you can do what they do. 
&gt; 
&gt; Which brings me to my second point. It‚Äôs all about material success. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre promising. Forget all that eye of the needle stuff. This is the prosperity Gospel. Come to Jesus and he will proved you‚Äôre saved by filling up your bank account and making you rich. This is why they don‚Äôt blink an eye at rich preachers. Getting rich is the whole point of the religion. You just do exactly what we say and give us your total loyalty and you‚Äôll get your reward. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, when I say getting rich is the whole point, that‚Äôs a tiny stretch. *Any* sign that you got a leg up on your enemies also helps to prove that you‚Äôre one of God‚Äôs elect. So power is good, too. Also hot babes. Inside connections. Etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why is this so important? This kind of religion doesn‚Äôt always attract the most top-drawer people. They‚Äôre often people who are sensitive about their place in the world. They may be poor. Or they have prickly egos because their car dealerships brought them lots of cash but not enough respect. Or‚Äîand I see this often‚Äîthey‚Äôve made a lot of fucked up choices in their lives and they can‚Äôt stand the thought that people are looking down in them. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now do you get it? 
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúSee, we‚Äôre the ones with Trump. He‚Äôs one of us because he don‚Äôt talk all smart like the rest of them. And when Trump really stuck it to that elitist bitch Hillary and all those libs that look down on us, then we won, too. That means God likes us better than them, hahaha. And Trump is rich, so that proves he‚Äôs chosen, too, hahaha. ‚Äú
&gt; 
&gt; He‚Äôs a winner. (Haven‚Äôt you ever noticed how bizarrely often they repeat that?) That makes them winners, too. It‚Äôs really easy for them to overlook anything else. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I‚Äôm glad other people found this helpful. I had a really hard time understanding it all myself. I was raised in a big Christian mainstream church to be fairly religious but not fanatical. Maybe I‚Äôm not so religious anymore, but I can still understand the various major flavors of Christianity.  So why did these people seem so bizarre?
&gt; 
&gt; It turns out, my knowledge of Christianity actually hurt me and stopped me from hearing what these people were actually saying. I had assumed they shared the same basic values as other Christians. Help the poor and the sick. Be humble and sorry for your sins. That kind of thing. 
&gt; 
&gt; But they don‚Äôt. They have different values. So when you attack their leaders as being hypocritical, they just dismiss you. A rich man who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about people may be betraying *your* interpretation of Christianity, but it doesn‚Äôt betray theirs. It embodies it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I learned this only as an adult dealing with various midsize businesses in the South and parts of the West for work. People would give me these weird devotional books to understand their company better and I would think, WTF? Now I get it. Of course your religion is related to your business. They‚Äôre actually the same thing. "

&gt; 
&gt; They also have extensive articles about cambridge analyticas military grade behavioral targeting ai and bots on twitter/facebook.
&gt; 
&gt; They are obviously going to respond in kind.
&gt; 
&gt; The difference is they have no idea how to create the kind of ai the hedge fund manager/computer scientist at cambridge analytica created that made him a billionaire many times over in less than a decade.
&gt; 
&gt; So instead they do the easy thing and dominate r politics.
&gt; 
&gt; Their twitter bots are haphazard and they have no idea what they are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; Wheras cambridge analytica used facebook ads which is totally legit and twitter bots which everyone is doing to actually micro target people based on behavior and feed them strategic pro trump material/anticlinton material.
&gt; 
&gt; Shareblue cant come close so instead they try to propagandize discussion on a supposedly neutral discussion board, and create an echo chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; It wont work. They are preaching to the choir. 
&gt; 
&gt; And also, it destroys real discussion and if they have any hope to convince swing voters its in actually legitimately being able to convince people that their policies are better than trumps within actual debate.
&gt; 
&gt; But the left is trying to just supress all dissent and meanwhile cambridge analytics no doubt is picking up data from what they are doing and will use it to even further enhance their microtargeting and will completely destroy them come election time.
&gt; 
&gt;  Cambridge analytica is playing a sophisticated game where they try to convince people fairly.
&gt; 
&gt; Shareblue is trying to delegitimize trump by supressing all discussion that makes trump look good and totally ruining free speech.
&gt; 
&gt; Cambridge analytica is doing sophisticated attraction marketing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Shareblue is trying to spam the entire internet and ruining free organic discussion.

The women were working hard inside of the home for the family. They all knew their place in the family. Women depended upon their husbands to support them and men depended upon their wives to bear children and take care of the family.

This means most people who voted didn't vote for the opponent but for Trump - Which is false. Mainly because of the usage of ""most"".

Many Americans didn't vote for a candidate running against trump. More  Americans didn't vote for Trump.




"
ani625,"&gt; Yes, that is because America doesn't have compulsory voting.

True , but not ""because"". There's no way real way to know who would have won if 100% of people voted. 

&gt; Which is what the point I was making was about.

Not true. You were trying to project that more people liked Trump, which is false. 



&gt; But I can see that point being missed if you indeed view voting as a right not a duty.

I have no views on that. ~~My view~~ Fact is the unpopular candidate won."

Ok, **but more than that *most* didn't vote for Trump**, which is **70.2%** (using your numbers).

&gt; 
&gt; A man has driven a car through the doors of a Russian airport terminal and driven around the premises as officers desperately attempted to stop him.
&gt; 
&gt; CCTV footage shows a grey car ploughing through snow and into the doors of the Kazan International Airport terminal, taking several attempts to crash its way through, while policemen try to open the car doors.
&gt; 
&gt; Separate CCTV footage from inside the airport then shows the driver, who was reportedly intoxicated at the time, proceed to drive through the building as police continue to chase it and shocked members of the public dodge its path.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally the vehicle smashes through another door to exit the airport terminal, at which point it stops and officers are able to open the driver door. The footage then cuts off.
&gt; 
&gt; Following the incident, Kazan Airport tweeted that no one was injured, but RT.com reports that some officers were hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; A water pipe in the terminal was reportedly broken, causing a flood in the building, of which the total damage was estimated to be around $100,000 (¬£81,600).
&gt; 
&gt; The driver was sentenced to 15 days in jail and two more criminal cases were opened against him for allegedly endangering the lives of officers and intentionally destroying property, RT.com reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the gravity of the crime, some have appeared to view the incident as comical, adding music behind the video and sharing it on social media."

ani625,"&gt; Fossils unearthed in India that are 1.6 billion years old and look like red algae may represent the earliest-known plants, a discovery that could force scientists to reassess the timing of when major lineages in the tree of life first appeared on Earth.

Researchers on Tuesday described the tiny, multicellular fossils as two types of red algae, one thread-like and the other bulbous, that lived in a shallow marine environment alongside mats of bacteria. Until now, the oldest-known plants were 1.2-billion-year-old red algae fossils from the Canadian Arctic.

####So, this is supposedly **400 million years** older, damn.


&gt; Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. There is evidence indicating life first appeared in the form of marine bacteria roughly 3.7 to 4.2 billion years ago. Only much later did plants and subsequently animals appear in the primordial seas.

&gt; The fossils also contained structures at the center of each cell wall typical of red algae.

&gt; At the time, Earth's land surfaces were largely barren, life was mainly microbial and atmospheric oxygen was at 1 to 10 percent of current levels."

&gt; **Trump advocates Russian hacking**
&gt; 
&gt; Donald J. Trump said on Wednesday that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, essentially urging a foreign adversary to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúRussia, if you‚Äôre listening, I hope you‚Äôre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,‚Äù Mr. Trump said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs deleted emails. ‚ÄúI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html
&gt; 
&gt; **Russia was involved in passing along hacked information about the Clinton campaign to Wikileaks**
&gt; 
&gt; Officials briefed on the matter were told that intelligence agencies had found that individuals linked to the Russian government had provided WikiLeaks with thousands of confidential emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and others.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow‚Äîthe Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.""
&gt; 
&gt; In early May, the DNC called in CrowdStrike, a security firm that specializes in countering advanced network threats.
&gt; After deploying their tools on the DNC‚Äôs machines, and after about two hours of work, CrowdStrike found ‚Äútwo sophisticated adversaries‚Äù on the Committee‚Äôs network.
&gt; 
&gt; CrowdStrike linked both groups to ‚Äúthe Russian government‚Äôs powerful and highly capable intelligence services.‚Äù APT 29, suspected to be the FSB, had been on the DNC‚Äôs network since at least summer 2015. APT 28, identified as Russia‚Äôs military intelligence agency GRU, had breached the Democrats only in April 2016, and probably tipped off the investigation.

--- 
&gt; 
&gt; In the last 650k years, Earth has gone through 7 periods of glacial advance and retreat. The last was 7k years ago, marking the end of the Ice Age.
&gt; 
&gt; CO2 was demonstrated to trap heat in the mid 19th century. In the course of the last 650k years, Earth atmospheric CO2 levels has never been above 300ppm, and we know that through mineral deposits, fossils, and arctic ice leaving telltale predictable signs of how much CO2 must have been in the air at the time. Today, CO2 is over 400ppm. Not only have we kept fantastic records pre-industrial revolution, especially the Swedes for centuries, but arctic ice has acted as a more recent history of the last several dozen centuries. CO2 levels has been growing at unprecedented rates and achieving levels higher than we've ever known to occur that wasn't in the wake of planetary disaster and mass extinction. It follows that if CO2 traps heat, and there's more CO2 in the atmosphere than ever before, it's going to trap more heat than ever before.
&gt; 
&gt; Sea levels are rising. 17cm over the last century. The last decade alone has seen twice the rise of the previous century. So not only are the oceans rising, but the rate of rise is increasing *exponentially*.
&gt; 
&gt; The Earth's average temperature has increased since 1880, most of that has been in the last 35 years. 15 of the 16 hottest years have been since 2001. We're in a period of solar decline, where the output of the sun cycles every 11 or so years. Despite the sun putting out less energy, the average continues to rise and in 2015 the Earth's average was 1C hotter on average than in 1890. That doesn't sound like much, but if we go some 0.7C hotter, we'll match the age of the dinosaurs when the whole planet was a tropical jungle. That's not a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; The ice caps are losing mass. While we've seen cycles of recession and growth, you have to consider ice is more than area, it's also thickness and density. Yes, we've seen big sheets of ice form, but A) they didn't stay, and B) how thick were they? Greenland has lost 60 cubic miles of ice and Antarctica has lost at least 30 cubic miles, both in the last decade. Greenland is not denying global warming, they're feverishly building ports to poise themselves as one of the most valuable ocean trading hubs in the world as the northern pass is opening, and it's projected you'll be able to sail across the north pole, a place you can currently stand, year-round.
&gt; 
&gt; Glacier ice is retreating all over the world, in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.
&gt; 
&gt; The number of unprecedented intense weather events has been increasing since 1950 in the US. The number of record highs has been increasing, and record lows decreasing.
&gt; 
&gt; The ocean absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere. CO2 and water makes carbonic acid, - seltzer water! The oceans are 30% more acidic since the industrial revolution. 93% of The Great Barrier Reef has been bleeched and 22% and rising is dead as a consequence. The ocean currently absorbs 9.3 billion tons of CO2 a year and is currently absorbing an additional 2 billion tons annually. Not because the ocean is suddenly getting better at it, but because there's more saturation in the atmosphere.

&gt;    Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It's a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened. And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton. Because what has happened is by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she is going to say, ‚ÄúOh, he loves Assad.‚Äù He's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean cash, bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.
&gt; 
&gt;    Now they have aligned, he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don't want ISIS. But they have other things because we're backing, we're backing rebels. We don't know who the rebels are. We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don't know who the rebels are. And when and if, and it's not going to happen because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up as bad as Assad is, and he is a bad guy.
&gt; 
&gt;    But you may very well end up with worse than Assad. If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape. And this is what has caused the great migration where she has taken in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who probably in many cases, not probably, who are definitely in many cases ISIS-aligned. And we now have them in our country and wait until you see this is going to be the great Trojan horse.

&gt;  Police in the US say a man who claims to have taken LSD and cough medicine drove his car into his next door neighbour's house to rescue their dog from an imaginary fire.

&gt; New York State Troopers say they found Michael Orchard (43) standing heroically with a dog in his arms after he allegedly drove his vehicle through the neighbour's fence, kicked the door down and snatched the pet.
&gt; 
&gt; Trooper Mark Ceipel said: ""Troopers found an individual standing in the middle of the roadway with a large white dog. He believed that the residence was on fire. And he was rescuing the dog. ""
&gt; 
&gt; Ceipel said Orchard was very cooperative. He was arrested and taken to the Saratoga County Jail. He faces charges including burglary.

After a light turned green at the junction of Richmond/Josiah Gumede Roads, several vehicles (including taxis full of home-bound commuters) began advancing and were struck side-on moments later by a truck careening down Field's Hill. The driver maintained that the brakes had failed as it descended the notorious hill approaching the intersection.

ani625,They're shot down because Pakistan countinues to wage proxy war through terrorism. One cannot expect to de-militarize Kashmir when it's being pounded by terrorists on a daily basis. 
ani625,"Whatever might be the consequences, it is clear that the Indian Army‚Äôs operation across the Line of Control in retaliation to a militant attack on its Uri camp is a landmark development. Now, it is common knowledge that both the Indian and Pakistani armies cross the LoC for tactical operations, and have been doing so for a long time.

Such operations, usually, have three characteristics: limitations in the depth of incursion, the extent of damage they cause and the level at which they are officially admitted. While we do not have all the details as of now, last night‚Äôs operation appears to have been deeper and more damaging. What distinguishes it from other tactical incursions along the LoC is the level at which they have been admitted: perhaps for the first time, New Delhi has officially announced that Indian troops carried out an attack authorised by the highest political authority.

This is significant because it changes the norm to one where India will use military force across its frontiers to respond to aggression by Pakistan‚Äôs proxies. Depending on the Pakistani reaction, the act might vindicate the arguments made by some strategists that India does have space for such punitive operations, within the escalation framework. If so, an important Pakistani bluff ‚Äî that nuclear weapons will shield its terrorist proxies ‚Äî will be called. 

This, however, is only the story so far. The ball now is in Pakistan‚Äôs court. If the Pakistani military establishment continues to hold the position that there was no ‚Äòsurgical strike‚Äô at all, and just the usual cross-border firing, then New Delhi would have succeeded in setting a new norm. However, if the Pakistani army decides that it cannot let this insult go unpunished, and responds tit-for-tat ‚Äî operationally and in public posturing ‚Äî then it will be up to the Modi government whether it wants to up the ante. There are good reasons for either course of action.

The Pakistani army‚Äôs initial reaction is what it is, an initial reaction. It could be used to obfuscate matters to cover a retaliatory attack. Or it could be a signal of not wanting to escalate the situation. At this time, therefore, it would be prudent for the Indian government and media to hold off excessive triumphalism.

ani625,"Hey everyone,

This is just a friendly reminder that discussion of suicide can be really difficult for those who are going  through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings. If you are feeling like you are not coping, please know that there are resources out there available to you.

There are [crisis services worldwide](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/) that are trained to provide support. These centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems, can help you get through a tough hour/night/week. 

Otherwise, if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope, I strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area. Just as you would see a doctor when you are sick, you deserve to take care of your mental health. 

Stay safe people."

- Control + L OR F6 OR Alt+D automatically selects the address bar.

- Control+Enter fills in the 'www' and '.com'.

- If you click a link with the scroll wheel button it opens in a new tab.


- CTRL + SHIFT + R or Ctrl + F5 will clear cache and then refresh page.

- Type the following into the address bar of your browser to convert a tab into a notepad:

I had also this list to the admins to get it banned sitewide, but normally takes a lot of time, they'll assess the sites and what not, that's ok. So back to modmail, I get a reply like ""So?"" or something to that effect. I was not sure what to respond with, I just said ""please remove this, it's spam. And possibly blacklist them"" and I receive this - ""We don't do that. We don't decide what's spam. That's admin's job. This is what the higher mods have told us to do."" I didn't bother replying to these idiots who don't know what a mod is supposed to do. I mean, these are sites like ""viralfact.com"" or ""wtfviralnews.com"", sites which are OBVIOUS spam.

ani625,These guys are not responsible for the attack. All they did was to raise money as a gesture. Is that bad? They are not cops to get the mother behind bars.

ani625,"&gt; The church, represented by a lawyer, wrote in a letter to DDOT, which WashCycle blog obtained and reported on, that the proposals along Sixth Street are ‚Äúunsupportable, unrealistic and particularly problematic for traffic and parking.‚Äù The church, which says it has more than 800 congregants, notes that the Convention Center is in the area, which already exacerbates traffic and parking issues. Consequently, as many car lanes as possible on the street are needed.

&gt; The parking loss would place an unconstitutionally undue burden on people who want to pray, the church argues, noting that other churches already have had to flee to the suburbs because of similarly onerous parking restrictions. The church says that DDOT lets cars park diagonally on the street during busy times, which would be seemingly impossible if a protected bike lane were on the street.

[How is the gender of some reptiles determined by temperature?](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-temperature-sex-determination-reptiles/)

&gt; In temperature-dependent sex determination, however, it is the environmental temperature during a critical period of embryonic development that determines whether an egg develops as male or female. This thermosensitive period occurs after the egg has been laid, so sex determination in these reptiles is at the mercy of the ambient conditions affecting egg clutches in nests. For example, in many turtle species, eggs from cooler nests hatch as all males, and eggs from warmer nests hatch as all females. In crocodilian species‚Äîthe most studied of which is the American alligator‚Äîboth low and high temperatures result in females and intermediate temperatures select for males.

It asks the United Nations human rights office only ‚Äúto provide technical assistance and to work with the government of Yemen, as required, in the field of capacity building.

Here's another - Why I Did Not Reign,
by Eve Merriam

---

I longed to win the spelling bee

And remembered the rule

I had learned in school:

""I before E,

Except after C.""

Friend, believe me,

No one was going to deceive me.

Fiercely I practiced, the scepter I'd wield,

All others their shields in the field would yield!

Alas, before my very eyes

A weird neighbor in a beige veil

Feigning great height and weighty size

Seized the reins and ran off with the prize.

Now I no longer deign to remember that rule.

Neither

Any other either. "

 I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I axe of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and except the fax. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it‚Äôs a peach of cake."

ani625,"&gt; The lander was ejected once atmospheric buffeting broke the interplanetary bus's lock-on with Earth. The parachute opened at a height of 60 km and atmospheric testing began with results showing the atmosphere to be 97% carbon dioxide. During the descent the parachute appeared to fail, resulting in a more rapid than planned descent. As a result the lander struck the surface of Venus at about 16.5 metres per second (54 ft/s) at 05:37:10 UTC. Landing coordinates are 5¬∞S 351¬∞E.

 &gt; The probe appeared to go silent on impact.However, recording tapes kept rolling. A few weeks later, upon a reviewing of the tapes, another 23 minutes of very weak signals were found on them. The spacecraft had landed on Venus and probably bounced onto its side upon impact, leaving the medium gain antenna not aimed correctly for strong signal transmission to Earth.[4] The only data returned from the surface were temperature readings, which gave a temperature of 475 ¬∞C (887 ¬∞F).

 "
ani625,"The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:

  &gt; No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization‚Äôs oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.

&gt; In the words of eyewitness Harry Uhler, ""I never saw so much fire in my life.""

&gt; The Venus rocket never left the ground, though it did succeed in drawing a substantial crowd, and probably an ambulance. The hopeful astronauts decided that what they needed was a booster and, as they figure that would cost them at least $10,000, they gave up the entire project. ""Our wives were against the whole deal, anyway,"" lamented Harry. Condit returned later, loaded the rocket onto a truck and headed for Florida...where he disappears from history.

ani625,"Most annoying?

 I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I axe of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and except the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it‚Äôs a peach of cake."

&gt; Freud derived much of his information on homosexuality from psychiatrists and sexologists such as Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Magnus Hirschfeld, and was also influenced by Eugen Steinach, a Viennese endocrinologist who transplanted testicles from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation. Freud stated that Steinach's research had ""thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of homoeroticism"", but cautioned that it was premature to expect that the operations he performed would make possible a therapy that could be generally applied. In his view, such transplant operations would be effective in changing sexual orientation only in cases in which homosexuality was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of the opposite sex, and probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism. In fact Steinach‚Äôs method was doomed to failure because the immune systems of his patients rejected the transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful."

ani625,"&gt; Reddit is fucking dead in my mind and this announcement confirmed it for me. It's quite sad, I remember first visiting before making an account around 9 years ago and it was a bastion for intelligent tech conversation. Soon Reddit evolved into a social website but maintained its independence from other bottom feeding Web 2.0 sites. Aaron Schwartz is rolling in his grave at this garbage and the CEO who is installing it.
Does Mitt Romney count as an individual? Because if you're going to go down this dark path, you have a LOT of subreddits to ban. Mitt Romney got harassed worse than anyone I've ever seen on Reddit, far worse than any fat person being harassed by /r/fatpeoplehate (which they didn't actually do). What you're doing is setting a precedent which cannot possibly be enforced except by the caprice of Admins . . . and I think that's EXACTLY what you want. If the subreddit was ""/r/WBC_Hate"" there's no way you would have banned it. You're making a choice that you care more about fat people as a group than members of the WBC (or any other group that is widely hated) and by Administrators making a personal choice as to what is supported and what is not, you're doing far more risk to Reddit than you could possibly remove by banning /r/fatpeoplehate. I hope you realize what you're doing. I don't think you do."

&gt; The SBG was founded in 1931 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Laden Sayyid, whose relationship with the country's founder, Abdel Aziz al Saud, led to important government contracts such as refurbishing the mosques at Mecca and Medina. Mohammed, who overall had 22 wives (including ex-wives) and 53 children, **is also the father of Osama Bin Laden.**"
ani625,"&gt; The foundation will be similar to that of the Burj Khalifa, but larger. It is expected to be around 60 metres (197 ft) deep with a concrete pad of around 7,500 m2 (80,729 sq ft). The concrete will have to have low permeability to keep out corrosive salt water from the Red Sea. Its depth and size is also considered to be an indicator of what the tower's final height will be. The piles will be up to 200 metres (656 ft) deep and the pad over 90 metres (295 ft) across, yet even still the building, which will weigh over 900,000 tons, is expected to settle. The idea is that it settles evenly enough so that the building doesn't tip or put undue stress on the superstructure. Computer modeling programs performed tests at the site to confirm that the foundation design would work. A later design for the foundation, to be constructed by Bauer in 2013, calls for 270 bored piles up to 110 metres (361 ft) deep which have to be installed into the difficult ground conditions. Some materials needed for the structure are 500,000 cubic meters of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel.

The foundation will be 110 meters (360 feet) deep. Damn.

--- 

I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and except the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it‚Äôs a peach of cake."

&gt; As the top administrator dealing with sexual assaults at the Charlottesville school, Nicole Eramo's lawsuit said she was cast as the ""chief villain"" in the discredited and debunked piece, titled ""A Rape on Campus.""

&gt;The fraternity where Rolling Stone falsely claimed the brutal sexual assault occurred has also given strong signals it plans to sue.

&gt; Eramo, associate dean of students at U.Va., came off as indifferent in the lengthy and graphic magazine piece about a student identified only as ""Jackie,"" who claimed she was raped by seven men in a fraternity initiation.

&gt; ""I am filing this defamation lawsuit to set the record straight ‚Äî and to hold the magazine and the author of the article accountable for their actions in a way they have refused to do themselves,"" Eramo said in a statement.

The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie and land in the surrounding area, and caused problems for traffic and a nearby airport. **The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.** In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of US dollars in damages, and cost overruns put the event in the red.

&gt; Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the ""asteroid field"" of balloons. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore.

And so ended the tale of Rabbit and Fox. For many years they had shared each others company. Had a good, many laugh, and shared many good memories. They decided to let their final resting place be a tribute to how they had lived.

As usual Fox had to go first. He curled his long tail behind him, tucked his paws underneath, and laid down. Rabbit came to lay beside him and comfort him as he departed. Fox gave a great sigh, and for the last time, closed his eyes. Rabbit stroked his fur, knowing that soon the warmth would be gone. Rabbit laid his head against Fox's chest to confirm what he already knew. When he closed his eyes he could see their younger years, as vibrantly as if it were real. He hugged Fox hard, hoping to hold on to their friendship forever.

Within a few moments Rabbit's breath had grown shorter, and he felt so tired. A short nap with Fox would be so nice. He had been a good friend. With that final thought Rabbit drew his final breath, and died.

ani625,"[This is correct.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Pen#Uses_in_the_U.S._and_Russian_space_programs)

&gt; A common urban legend states that NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in space (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviets just used pencils. There is a grain of truth: NASA began to develop a space pen, but when development costs skyrocketed the project was abandoned and astronauts went back to using pencils, along with the Soviets. However, the claim that NASA spent millions on the Space Pen is incorrect, as the Fisher pen was developed using private capital, not government funding. NASA ‚Äì and the Soviets‚Äì eventually began purchasing such pens.

&gt; NASA programs previously used pencils (for example a 1965 order of mechanical pencils) but because of the substantial dangers that broken pencil tips and graphite dust pose to electronics in zero gravity, the flammable nature of wood present in pencils, and the inadequate quality documentation produced by non-permanent or smeared recordkeeping, a better solution was needed. Russian cosmonauts used pencils, and grease pencils on plastic slates until also adopting a space pen in 1969 with a purchase of 100 units for use on all future missions.NASA never approached Paul Fisher to develop a pen, nor did Fisher receive any government funding for the pen's development. Fisher invented it independently and then, in 1965, asked NASA to try it. After extensive testing, NASA decided to use the pens in future Apollo missions. Subsequently, in 1967 it was reported that NASA purchased approximately 400 pens for $6 a piece."

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.

CTRL+F ""about tree fiddy"" was not disappointed.

Wait, why do I have you tagged as ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as ""YOU HAD ONE JOB"". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.

Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS.

...this kills the redditor.

ani625,"I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it‚Äôs a peach of cake."

ani625,"&gt; you can't burp in space. This is all to do with gravity. On Earth gravity assists with our burps by holding all the solid and wet waste in our stomachs exactly there, in our stomachs. In space gravity can't assist, thus the gas expelled during burping is joined by all its solid and liquid friends, turning your burp into a vomit. This is obviously not a pleasant experience for our astronaut or their crewmates.  We will be calling this a **Bomit** from now on.

So let it be written..
"
ani625,"&gt;  'Can you fart in space?'
Well the simple answer is yes! 

&gt;  I guess it is worth noting that while yes you can fart in space, it might not be the most pleasant thing to do. This is because while you are in space there tends to be very little ventilation. A fart on Earth, no matter how smelly, tends to be quite a short lived amusement. In space however you can't just open a window, especially if you are in a space suit. This will result in your 'bottom cough' sticking around for a lot longer. This is not going to be pleasant for anybody on board.

&gt; Your blood is under pressure. If you insert two needles into the same artery or vein, they're under the same pressure. The device pictured will fill up with blood from both ends until the pressure is equalized.
At this point it will not readily go back into the veins at either end. The device is not a blood vessel under the same pressure as a vein.
If you're confused, imagine puncturing a garden hose in two places and attaching a tube between those two points. What do you think will happen? Yep, water will spray out of both holes. It will eventually fill the tube. It may even slightly flow through the bypass, but this isn't likely, since the pressure at either end is going to be roughly equal. More than anything, the fluid flow will ignore the bypass and take the path of least resistance through the main vein.
Further, if it does manage to flow back into the vein at either end, you will be introducing bubbles of air. Additionally, without the presence of a blood thinning agent and anti-coagulant, it will begin to clot very quickly. This is what blood does. You do not want air bubbles or clots re-entering your bloodstream. This is bad. Clots, especially, will give you a stroke or a heart attack. Small bubbles are more survivable, but still not a happy thing.
Now, there have been historical methods of direct blood transfusion, but they are incredibly complicated and these techniques often involved taking blood from the donor at a major artery by actually cutting open that artery and suturing or piping it into a lower pressure, smaller vein in the recipient.
Beyond very, very old and risky techniques, almost every blood transfusion technique out there involves using a pump of some kind, whether it's syringes or a gravity fed reservoir like a bag or in modern cases, an actual pump. And even these only work with anti-coagulants or container surface treatments to prevent coagulation. (They used to use paraffin wax coatings inside glass collection vessels, and it didn't always work.)
And we haven't even touched on infections. No where in that picture do I see an iodine skin prep, which is something you even see in body piercing. Whenever you go in to give blood, plasma or get your blood drawn for a test, they clean the skin around the puncture site for about 4 inches in all directions using iodine or another high strength cleaning agent. (These are usually iodine based, unless you're allergic to it.)
(No, I'm not a doctor, I'm just a generalist nerd. This is not medical advice. Don't jam needles into your own veins even if you are a junkie and/or phlebotomist, you idiot.)

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies yellowjackets, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls hornets yellowjackets. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""yellowjacket family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Vespidae, which includes things from wasps to sawflies to beewolves.

So your reasoning for calling a hornet a yellowjacket is because random people ""call the yellow ones yellowjackets?"" Let's get black wasps and paper wasps in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A hornet is a hornet and a member of the wasp family. But that's not what you said. You said a hornet is a yellowjacket, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the wasp family yellowjackets, which means you'd call sawflies, beewolves, and other wasps yellowjackets, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

&gt; The man in question was attempting to smuggle more than a dozen of the tiny creatures through Rochambeau airport in Cayenne, French Guiana.
He created crude pouches in the front of the inside of his trousers to contain the un-sedated hummingbirds.
Furthermore, each bird was cruelly wrapped in cloth before being placed in its pouch, in order to prevent an escape attempt, which would no doubt prove painful for the wearer of the trousers.
Luckily, officials noticed the traveller acting suspicious, and upon removing his trousers, discovered their unusual cargo.
This was not the man‚Äôs first hummingbird smuggling attempt, however, as he is known to hold a previous conviction for the same offence.

&gt; It is not known whether he has yet been charged.
Although sitting through a plane ride with a variety of animals in your pants does not sound particularly appealing, it is apparently a popular method of moving creatures illegally from country to country.
A man from Florida was arrested at Miami airport last month, after attempting to smuggle seven snakes and three tortoises onto a flight by concealing them in his pants.
Fortunately, a body scanner picked up the unusual contents of his trousers before he could board his plane to Brazil."

ani625,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign

&gt; during which the Communist Party of China (CPC) encouraged its citizens to openly express their opinions of the communist regime. Differing views and solutions to national policy were encouraged based on the famous expression by Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong: ""The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is designed to promote the flourishing of the arts and the progress of science."" After this brief period of liberalization, Mao abruptly changed course. The crackdown continued through 1957 as an Anti-Rightist Campaign against those who were critical of the regime and its ideology. Those targeted were publicly criticized, condemned to prison labor camps and in many cases executed. Mao remarked at the time that he had ""enticed the snakes out of their caves.""

ani625,"The oldest known mammalian cell line in existence is 'Canine transmissible venereal tumor' It's a sexually transmitted genital cancer affecting dogs. The current cell line is believed to be somewhere between 200 and 2500 years old but its ancestor lines have been traced back much further; up to 6000 years ago.

ani625,"There's an interesting a book about the cell line and its origins called [""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortal_Life_of_Henrietta_Lacks.) A great read on the subject.

&gt; It is about Henrietta Lacks and the immortal cell line, known as HeLa, that came from her cervical cancer cells in 1951. The book is notable for its science writing and dealing with ethical issues of race and class in medical research. Rebecca Skloot writes in her book that some of the information was taken from the journal of Deborah Lacks, Henrietta Lacks's daughter, as well as from ""archival photos and documents, scientific and historical research"""

ani625,"&gt;    Oxfam has accepted Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs decision to step down after eight years as a Global Ambassador and we are grateful for her many contributions.

   &gt; While Oxfam respects the independence of our ambassadors, Ms. Johansson‚Äôs role promoting the company SodaStream is incompatible with her role as an Oxfam Global Ambassador.

  &gt; Oxfam believes that businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support.

  &gt;  Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law. Ms. Johansson has worked with Oxfam since 2005 and in 2007 became a Global Ambassador, helping to highlight the impact of natural disasters and raise funds to save lives and fight poverty.

Fair enough on their part.

ani625,"&gt; African honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species. The honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching, much as cuckoo hatchlings do. The honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it, so that it has a head start in development compared to the host

So it not only assists in honey robbery, but also forces other birds to raise its chicks? This has got to be the shadiest bird in existence."

However, this etymology is not accepted by several French linguists, as there is, notably, no occurrence of this word until the end of the 19th century. **Others say the name comes from a type of aperitif, called a bistrouille  (or liqueur coffee), served in some reasonably priced restaurants.**

They're a relatively unknown YouTube channel hosted by Dugan Ashley that provides a satirical look at firearms culture. His videos are aimed very heavily towards the firearms community, so those who don't know much about them might find his videos a little strange and hard to follow. He will sometimes use a good deal of technical jargon in his videos. Most of the material is quite accessible though. You don't need to know about guns to know that dual wielding automatic weapons while dressed up like an American flag is fucking hilarious.

ani625,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistletoe#Kissing_under_mistletoe_at_Christmas

&gt;In Norse mythology, Baldr was a god of vegetation. His mother, Frigga, prompted by a prophetic dream, made every plant, animal and inanimate object promise not to harm him.

&gt;But Frigga overlooked the mistletoe plant ‚Äî and the mischievous god Loki took advantage of this oversight, tricking the blind god H√∂√∞r  into killing Baldr with a spear fashioned from mistletoe. Baldr's death brought winter into the world, until the gods restored him to life.

&gt;Frigga declared the mistletoe sacred, ordering that from now on it should bring love rather than death into the world. Happily complying with Frigga's wishes, any two people passing under the plant from now on would celebrate Baldr's resurrection by kissing under the mistletoe.

ani625,"&gt; Reincarnation Chart
&gt;
&gt; Level 1 (OK)
&gt;
&gt; If you have ""Polite"" Sex with your Wife/Husband your child (or re-incarnation) will be a son
&gt;
&gt; If you have ""Romantic"" Sex with your Wife/Husband your child (or re-incarnation) will be a daughter
&gt;
&gt; If you have Kinky Sex with your Wife/Husband your child (or re-incarnation) will be a lady boy

&gt; Level 2 (Not OK)
&gt;
&gt; If you have sex at a party (before wedlock/for free) you're reincarnated as a dog
&gt;
&gt; If you have gay sex at a party you're reincarnated as an ""Entertain Dog"" (Presumably lower than a normal dog)
&gt;
&gt; Level 3 (Bad) - Spirit can't reincarnate into a higher level, ends up disintegrating
&gt;
&gt; If you pay for sex then you're reincarnated as a Black Rat
&gt; 
&gt; If you're paying for a lot of sex then you're reincarnated as a Cockrach
&gt;
&gt; How to you avoid bad re-incarnations? Be Austere in your ways or be a vegetarian and ensure to get good sleep
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Bonus Round: Masturbating will send you blind and Orphans are actually re-incarnated ""Accidents"" (Possibly rapes) that were aborted

ani625,"This is highly inaccurate. According to[ the court ruling:](http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21362297/)

&gt; As regards the offence punishable under Section 376 IPC the deceased was aged around 65-70 years, thus beyond the age of menopause. We find force in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that even if the sexual intercourse was forceful it was not forcible and contrary to the wishes and consent of the deceased. From the MLC of Achey Lal and the post-mortem of the deceased it is evident that both Achey Lal and deceased had consumed alcohol. The forceful penetration is evident from the injuries on the vaginal orifices. However, besides the injuries on the vagina there is no other injury mark on the body of the deceased or on the appellant to show that there was any protest by the deceased. Hence we are of the opinion that it has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed sexual intercourse with the deceased contrary to her wishes or her consent. Consequently the appellant is also acquitted of the charges under Section 376 IPC. The impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence are set aside. 

What it says is that there is no *clear* evidence that it was not consensual in nature, and the prosecution could only prove that it was rough sex, not rape."

ani625,"An excerpt of the anti-war speech that earned Eugene V. Debs 10 years in prison.

---
Wars throughout history have been waged for conquest and plunder. In the Middle Ages when the feudal lords who inhabited the castles whose towers may still be seen along the Rhine concluded to enlarge their domains, to increase their power, their prestige and their wealth they declared war upon one another. But they themselves did not go to war any more than the modern feudal lords, the barons of Wall Street go to war.

The feudal barons of the Middle Ages, the economic predecessors of the capitalists of our day, declared all wars. And their miserable serfs fought all the battles. The poor, ignorant serfs had been taught to revere their masters; to believe that when their masters declared war upon one another, it was their patriotic duty to fall upon one another and to cut one another's throats for the profit and glory of the lords and barons who held them in contempt. And that is war in a nutshell. The master class has always declared the wars; the subject class has always fought the battles. The master class has had all to gain and nothing to lose, while the subject class has had nothing to gain and all to lose--especially their lives.

They have always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war and to have yourselves slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world you, the people, have never had a voice in declaring war, and strange as it certainly appears, no war by any nation in any age has ever been declared by the people.

&gt;  About a hundred of these dodecahedra have been found from Wales to Hungary and to the east of Italy, with most found in Germany and France. Ranging from 4 cm to 11 cm in size, they also vary in terms of textures. Most of them are made of bronze but some also seem to be made of stone.
No mention of them has been found in contemporary accounts or pictures of the time. Speculated uses include candlestick holders (wax was found inside one example); dice; survey instruments; devices for determining the optimal sowing date for winter grain; gauges to calibrate water pipes or army standard bases. It has also been suggested that they may have been religious artifacts of some kind. This latter speculation is based on the fact that most of the examples have been found in Gallo-Roman sites"

&gt; Can you imagine it? Walking alone in utter darkness, just your hand on the wall. Your mouth dry from dehydration, your throat and lungs burning from the rank air and the countless hours of screaming for help. Your feet blistered messes and your legs sore to the point of exhaustion. Just walking. Nothing around you but solid darkness and cold damp walls in every direction. You'd have so much time to reflect on your life, everyone you've known, every event replaying over in your head. Somewhere along the line it hits you: ""You aren't getting out."" I wonder if she broke down and stopped moving on, giving in to despair or dehydration, sobbing to herself as she slumped to the cold hard ground. Nothing to comfort her, nothing to give hope. Or perhaps she kept going until she physically could not, driven by either the hallucinations that gave her false promise of salvation, or by the sheer will to live, keeping her going until she finally collapsed from exhaustion and dehydration. I also wonder if the rats started to eat her before she was completely dead.

&gt; Edit #3: Now for some history. The Catacombs are located in Odessa Ukraine, primarily. For those curious, originally the Catacombs were a series of many mines, mostly [Limestone mines (note the cut blocks on the minecart)](http://www.odessa-katakomb.narod.ru/images/nahodki/018m.jpg), that eventually grew to connect and intersect as they haphazardly spread out in search of new resources to mine. The total size is believed to exceed 2500km in length (1553~ miles) and is actually multilevel, going down to a depth of 60m below sea level. There are over 1000 known entrances and more continue to appear as tunnels and caves collapse, exposing new sections to the surface. The entire region had a mining boom in the 19th century and the Catacombs extend far outwards into the countryside around Odessa. In 1917 stone mining was banned in much of the region, and as a result the vast bulk of the Catacombs fell into immediate states of disrepair. Various sections of tunnels were repurposed over the years as either sewers, storehouses, or other purposes. Some abandoned tunnels were even used by smugglers (who would even add on to existing tunnels if needed) or used to hide all manner of people during World War II.

&gt; Because of turn of the century mining, in combination with poor maintenance and construction, many tunnels within the Catacombs have fallen into disrepair, and many areas are at risk of cave ins, rock falls, and [some sections are even flooded.](http://www.odessa-katakomb.narod.ru/images/mir/gigant_big.jpg) There's over 1000 known entrances, and monitoring or sealing them is a next to impossible task. Much of the Catacombs is off limits and access is (officially) highly restricted. Brave groups of spelunkers occasionally make journeys into the Catacombs, risking arrest and natural perils of the tunnels, in search for adventure and knowledge. Officially much of the Catacombs is unmapped, and the true extent of it isnt even fully known. However, since 1961 the Piosk club has been slowly exploring and mapping the tunnels under official authority. 

&gt; In modern times the Catacombs do have a museum, ""Museum of Partisan Glory"", attached to them, located at in Nerubayskoye, north of Odessa. The Catacomb's vast size has also prevented Odessa from building a subway, as they have encountered resistance from various historical and cultural groups, as well as logistical problems with regards to the notion of making safe or filling in large sections of tunnel. 

&gt; Edit #4: Final Edit: Good Night everybody this has been fun. I look forward to reading through the mountain of comments in the morning. As one last image I give you [the simple grave of one of the many to fall victim to the Catacombs.](http://www.odessa-katakomb.narod.ru/images/ygasu/tomb_big.jpg) May all who perish within that cold, dark, Hell find their peace."

ani625,"Some stuff I have listed:

- No one is entitled and you're replaceable.

- This world doesn't owe you shit. 

- Just because you try your best, spend lots of time and put a lot of effort into something, doesn't mean you'll succeed.

- You aren't special or entitled to anything, and no matter how good you are at something, there is always going to be someone who is better than you.

- No matter how much you invest in a person, trust a person, do everything for a person, think you love a person, they can always stab you in the back. And the more you love and trust them, the worse it will hurt if they do so.

- You are one person, out of 7 billion human beings currently alive. Your life span will be at best around 90 years. The universe is 14 billions years old. Your life and everything you do is completely meaningless and pointless.

- No one knows what they're doing. You think when you get older you'll figure shit out and life will make sense but it never does. People just do what they're told and claw forward hoping they didn't fuck up. 

- Shitty things happen whether or not you're a good person.

- You will die, and so will everyone else.

The war-weary Marine asked, ""Ma'am, may I have that seat?"" The French woman sniffed and said to no one in particular, ""Americans are so rude. My little Fifi is using that seat.""

The Marine walked the entire train again, but the only seat available was under that dog. ""Please, Ma'am. May I sit down? I'm very tired,"" he asked again. She snorted, ""Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant!"" This time the Marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, tossed it out the train window and sat down. The woman shrieked, ""Someone must defend my honor! Put this American in his place!""

An English gentleman sitting nearby spoke up. ""Sir, you Americans seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You hold the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you seem to have thrown the wrong bitch out the window.

&gt; This is actually legit; it's a bunch of Honeypots, dummy servers that attract hackers by having ""valuable data"" on them (which is usually nothing more than made up documents that look important). They're used to locate and sometimes identify the hackers to take them down and to track the current methods that hackers are using in real time to protect companies from day zero attacks and stuff similar. (my attempt to define it, I could be wrong, correct me if so)

&gt;
For example, one of the unknown ports that apparently is really popular to target right now is 21320. After a quick google it seems that it's a port used in Spybot and I guess there's a new exploit or something they're doing with that port. Really interesting stuff.

&gt; 
&gt; His implementation of Britain's trading policy has been blamed for increasing the severity of the famine. Critics have further attested that Lytton's belief in Social Darwinism regards the plight of the starving and dying Indians; 60,000 friends of the Raj banqueted whilst tons of rice and grain awaited export to Britain and America."

ani625,"&gt; Yes, because it gives you an unnecessary amount of control and gatekeeper status when you, as a regular user, shouldn't have it.

Regular users are *allowed* to create subs. They can do whatever they hell they want with it. If that wasn't the intention of the admins, they wouldn't allow mere users to create subs in the first place. 

&gt;Take for example one of your many abandonded subreddits, /r/Penicillin . **Let's say I wanted to use that for something**, you're the gatekeeper who gets to decide if I can do that. Problem number 1.

Why should anyone care what you want? You're free to create another sub, promote it, nurture it, grow it as you please. Why do you think, as some user, you somehow should have the authority to do anything?  

&gt;. Let's say you agree and I become a mod under you and build up a community there. Sometime down the line you decide you don't like the community I created and you have the power to change it, kill it or kick everyone out, that's problem number 2. 

Yes, that'll be a dick move and we have seen people doing that and other bad stuff, especially during the recent drama in some subs. I agree this is bad, and I agree with your point of ""power"". But that doesn't mean I *necessarily* go apeshit. I can assure you I've never pulled anything close to such a thing or have any intention to do so.

&gt; You didn't do anything to build up the community, why should you hold that power forever? Why should you hold any power? 


This is again speculation and assumption. 

&gt; This is incredibly arrogant. If someone wants to make a community they need your help to promote it huh?

It's not arrogant at all. I am not forcing anything or anyone mind you. If they want to sit in the boat I floated, they can take it or leave it. That is how the world works. Most of the time we work it out and put an effort as a team. You are always free to create a parallel sub as I said earlier. 

&gt; I'm a little disturbed how you went from assuming I was a nobody who contributed nothing to now 
being certain I am using an alt. 

Alright. Be it an alt or a main account, it is equally pathetic to sling shit on people just because ""you think"" they're onto some grand evil scheme.

&gt; Perhaps the secrecy I'm referring to is collusion between power users like yourself and the admins that allowed you to make that logical leap. 

Some great /r/conspiracy stuff here. The only time I ever talk to the admins is when I report sitewide rule violations (Personal info, etc) to them.

Edit: Formatting"

ani625,"&gt; I think that's just the problem, ""behind the scenes"" where mods power-trip over all the defaults shouldn't exist.

I agree, but what makes you think I'm ""power-tripping""? Do you have any exposure into the enormous amount of work that goes on? 

&gt; Can you justify the reason for the secrecy? 

What secrecy are you talking about? I'm not part of any circle or the illuminati here. 

&gt; Can you justify the reason for your having created hundreds of subreddits with no intention of doing anything with them?

What's the problem if it just sits with 1 subscriber? Is it doing anyone any harm? 

Moreover, subs which actually become big enough needs some promotion to be done by the mods, which we do, including myself. And I don't just sit over them for the sake of it. I actually do mod work.

And sitting behind an alt to witch-hunt people ""you don't like"" isn't exactly noble."
ani625,Great point. Mr. single comment in 4 years. As if you know what goes on behind the scenes. Quit witch-hunting and do something useful.
ani625,Patience young grasshopper. 
ani625,Maybe I am. Thanks.
ani625,I can't confirm or deny that.
ani625,"1. /r/wtf undefaulted many months ago and it was a TEAM decision. The default rule was only one of the factors for this decision.

2. As for the number of subs I moderate, I suggest you click on the subs and check for yourselves how many of them are big enough to *need* moderation. It's only about 10%."

ani625,"-    In 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American, whilst the 1966 Guinness Book of Records named him as the world's richest private citizen. At his death, he was worth more than $2 billion (approximately $8.1 billion in 2012).


- After his release the grandson called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone. The grandson was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, he was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life.

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.

CTRL+F ""about tree fiddy"" was not disappointed.

Wait, why do I have you tagged as ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as ""YOU HAD ONE JOB"". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.

Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS.

...this kills the redditor.

OP will surely deliver. In the meantime, I'll show myself out.

&gt;Policemen in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are offered cash incentives (an extra 30 rupees a month, or about 40p) to grow a moustache, which their bosses believe makes them better equipped to carry out their duties. It was the brainchild of the Jhabua district police chief, who noticed the positive effect that moustachioed policemen had on the public at a local event in 2004. But they don‚Äôt want to take things too far; authorities are keeping a watch on the shape of officer‚Äôs moustaches so they don‚Äôt become intimidating.

Etymology: The word boycott entered the English language during the Irish ""Land War"" and is derived from the name of Captain Charles Boycott, the land agent of an absentee landlord, Lord Erne, who lived in Lough Mask House, near Ballinrobe in County Mayo, Ireland, who was subject to social ostracism organized by the Irish Land League in 1880.

URA is more of a conventional type is his writing, but his unabashed criticism of upper caste &amp; hindus in general seems a bit extreme.

Story
&gt; 1975

&gt;The Darkest Chapter

&gt;The imposition of Emergency is by far the darkest chapter in our democracy. The suspension of civil liberties represented a draconian mindset of the British Raj. Like every right thinking citizen, I raised my voice against this grossly undemocratic step. I escaped arrest in the early hours of 26th June 1975 and organized the first protest against the Emergency that day and was arrested. I underwent imprisonment for 19 months in the Tihar Jail. The days in Jail unraveled the different facets of life before me as a interacted with people coming from diverse back grounds. It gave me a certain insight in to the working of the human mind, which would stand me in good stead in my later life.

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.

&gt;CTRL+F ""about tree fiddy"" was not disappointed.

&gt;Wait, why do I have you tagged as ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as ""YOU HAD ONE JOB"". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.

&gt;Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS.

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.

CTRL+F ""about tree fiddy"" was not disappointed.

Wait, why do I have you tagged as ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as ""YOU HAD ONE JOB"". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.

Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS.

...this kills the redditor.

OP will surely deliver. In the meantime, I'll show myself out.

ani625,"The last point is interesting - 

&gt;    [7]. (SBU) Comment: With an election around the corner, Congress is balancing the need to preserve law and order and protect minorities with its desire to avoid handing the BJP another opportunity to claim that Congress coddles minorities at the expense of the Hindu majority. Banning Bajrang Dal would signal that Congress is willing to risk losing votes from the Hindu right in hopes of consolidating minority Christian and Muslim votes. To ameliorate the impact on the Hindu vote, the party may pair its possible ban on Bajrang Dal with some sort of action against the Pentecostal churches. But there is something beyond politics at play in MK Narayanan and K.V. Thomas's easy acceptance of the argument that there is a moral equivalence between the thuggish Bajrang Dal and the followers of the New Life church. That an intelligence professional and a Catholic politician both feel this way shows mainstream society's deep-seated suspicions about the new Christian players -- especially the Pentecostal churches -- on the Indian scene."

Taking Bangalore for example, I am seeing the ongoing metro construction and ring-road Flyover/Underpass project first-hand, and it's taking 5x the time it's supposed to. 
Believe it or not, a single 300-400m flyover being built *very* wide road has already taken 3.5 years, and is yet to open. There are 15+ fly-overs with the same disease here, as opposed to ~5 which have opened recently. The metro just has a 7 km operating stretch after 6 long years of work, the target being 50+ km. The timeline for full completion was 5 years and it's nowhere near finished.  Mind you, both these project causes major road blockages due to the construction, and causes hours-long traffic jams all around the whole city. The daily commuter who dreams of using these facilities is looking at nothing but a pipe-dream. "

ani625,"&gt; So how did natural selection equip men to solve the adaptive problem of other men impregnating their sexual partners? The answer, according to Gallup, is their penises were sculpted in such a way that the organ would effectively displace the semen of competitors from their partner‚Äôs vagina, a well-synchronized effect facilitated by the ‚Äúupsuck‚Äù of thrusting during intercourse. Specifically, the coronal ridge offers a special removal service by expunging foreign sperm. According to this analysis, the effect of thrusting would be to draw other men‚Äôs sperm away from the cervix and back around the glans, thus ‚Äúscooping out‚Äù the semen deposited by a sexual rival.

ani625,"&gt;I understand the importance the resurrection story holds in your particular religion. If I too knew some guy that had been killed and placed inside a cave with a rock in front of it and I visited the cave to find the rock moved and his body gone, the only logical assumption would be that he had risen from the dead and is the son of God. Once, my friend Simon was rushed to hospital to have his appendix removed and I visited him the next day to find his bed empty. I immediately sacrificed a goat and burnt a witch in his name but it turned out that he had not had appendicitis, just needed a good poo, and was at home playing Playstation.
Someone probably should have asked ""So the rock has been moved and he's gone... has anyone checked his house?"" I realise Playstation was not around in those days but they probably had the equivalent. A muddy stick or something. I would have said ""Can someone please check if Jesus is at home playing with his muddy stick, if not, then and only then should we all assume, logically, that he has risen from the dead and is the son of God.""
