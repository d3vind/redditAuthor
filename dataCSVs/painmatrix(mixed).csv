PainMatrix,Interestingly there was already bipartisan agreement to release it although clearly for different reasons. 
PainMatrix,Same way I felt about Get Out. Pretty predictable plot but appreciated what he was going for. I feel like he’s on the cusp of being able to spread his wings and do something great and novel.

Lol. This is will get buried but I bought the album as a huge fan of dirt and not having heard anything off of it.

&gt; The film was a critical and **commercial** success; grossing $165 million worldwide and garnering praise for its humor, screenplay, and music. The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for McKenzie's ""Man or Muppet"", as well as garnering BAFTA and Critic's Choice Awards nominations.

PainMatrix,It gets hate? I haven’t watched it in 10-12 years but it used to be amazing. What is the hate about?
PainMatrix,"&gt;sweet

;). I just watched it again as I hadn’t watched it in at least 20 years. Stand by my original statement. Starts with him watching some people making out, then he drives out in the desert and nothing interesting happens. "
PainMatrix,I was just listening to “Today” by Smashing Pumpkins and remembering how cheesy that video was with Billy as an ice cream truck driver. 
PainMatrix,I don’t remember the whole thing but my girlfriend at the time (now my wife) was sobbing about it. I remember telling them I just took my car back and they told me the tow place said I broke their chains (which was a lie). The cops forced me to drive back there and then stranded me but the tow place let the whole thing go (except for the tow charge)
PainMatrix,"Very late but I did a version of this in college. 

Should preface by saying I have an orthopedic condition and during college it flared up and I had a handicap permit. Anyway, one night I forgot to put up my permit at the dorm and when I went out my car was gone. So... My roommate drove me to the tow yard that night and my car was there not locked up. So feeling in the right and angry at the tow company I just drove my car away. My girlfriend and I were hungry and went to get some pizza, I was at this point feeling like nothing was wrong except I was annoyed that I had to go through the hassle. 

By the time I got back to my dorm a couple of hours later there were 5 cop cars waiting for me. 

So anyway, this guy will definitely have this catch up to him. "
PainMatrix,"I have an important government job and couldn’t imagine not going to work and helping people. HOWEVER, if my work showed so little regard for me as to not pay me, I’d probably have to look for other ways to help people quickly. Also Trump has already shown other government workers like myself what he truly thinks of us by disregarding congress and continuing to freeze our cost of living increases (and I’m not even part of the shut-down). "
PainMatrix,"I saw Song of the South in Europe in 1984 when I was a kid and remember loving it. We can’t ban movies, then we turn into a fascist country. Doesn’t mean that you accept the movie and what was happening and say it’s okay, it’s not. I do think it’s important that we observe our past though. With this said of course Disney is a multi billion dollar company that doesn’t want to lose any of their reputation. "

PainMatrix,I was on a date when I was 14 at a McDonald’s and a group tweens I didn’t know ran up and dumped an entire cup of water on me and then ran like hell. I was so shocked I didn’t even move for a second. 25 years later and I’m still peeved about it.  
PainMatrix,I can’t stand this antiquated cliche of marriage. I’m sure there are people that feel this way but they should probably never have gotten married to begin with. I would spin around and stand on my head for my wife in a second and we’re in it almost 20 years.
PainMatrix,Anyone else annoyed that she doesn’t answer his questions though? 
PainMatrix,OP just made a joke that didn’t land. Nothing else to see there.

And this is an area of expertise that I have a PhD and have given a grand rounds talk in. Somethings not adding up. "
PainMatrix,"Yeah, that’s 4 pounds per week weight loss. Nearly impossible except with highly significant exercise. Wouldn’t put it past OP"
PainMatrix,I wonder that about a lot of redditors from a few years back. Wish I could remember names at the moment but there were a lot of active redditors 3-4 years ago on this site who are no longer on here. 
PainMatrix,"Lol, damn, weight loss and obesity is my area of expertise with my PhD. Oh well, I’m sure this will be asked again. "
PainMatrix,"Yeah, there was a thread on here recently where people said they could just move their money to Puerto Rico and the higher tax wouldn’t make a difference. I still like her passion and I think with more experience and knowledge she’ll do great. Her passion like her dancing is certainly unbridled and a breath of fresh air. "

PainMatrix,"The VA which I work for is not the military though. That’s the DOD. I’m sure he cares for veterans though, loved veteran POW’s like John McCain for sure. "
PainMatrix,"Thank you. As a front line VA mental health employee who does not have enough resources to help the people I’m dealing with I appreciate this. Equitably, the VA does not pay as much as the private sector and they’re going to continue to lose people until that’s changed. Trump also froze the cost of living increase for employees in the federal government this year meaning it’s going to continue to be under competitive. "
PainMatrix,Nice apology.

PainMatrix,It just happened to me 5 minutes ago so there might be a glitch in your matrix. 
PainMatrix,Nope. The first one came out broken and I popped out the other 3 and it landed exactly like this. My wife also thought I had faked it though so you’re in good company.

PainMatrix,"&gt;The Lingotto factory featured a unique upward spiral assembly line. As each Fiat was put together it would progress upwards through the building story by story. Each floor was sequentially designated to specialize in a major part of assembly. What would start on the ground floor as raw materials and individual parts became a running driving Fiat by the time it spiraled its way to the top of the building.

&gt;When a Fiat had finished its climb through the 16,000,000 square feet of Lingotto it exited the building by way of the roof. Each Fiat was taken on to the roof and around the banked race track to make sure the prior five floors of manufacturing had done their jobs to satisfaction. If the car was satisfactory, it would return down to ground level through one of the two spiral access ramps at either end of the test track."

This is the face of a gentleman who just FINISHED a plate of suicide wings. Our hottest wing at the Dew Drop Inn met it’s match today. Today this man is King Suicide Wing! #destinationdewdrop #dewdropinnct

u/zeronearhero:

As a person that managed to consume 2 of 5 I can tell you they are life altering hot. Whoever created this is a genius. The heat takes about 30 seconds to begin and surges for about 15 minutes until you’re saying things like “shit, this appetizer kinda ruined my ability to eat my main meal”. Nothing helps - NOTHING. These make your own breath too hot to breathe out of your dumb mouth.

The night I tried this the waitress was like “are you sure you want these? There are no refunds.” I love spicy foods, sauces, everything so I said what the hell. Word got around the bar that I managed to make it through two that the burley bouncer came up to congratulate me lol. Another guy got them at the same time and only made it through one bite.

This was also back when their portions were different. Smallest portion was five, now it’s seven. So this dude is legendary. The wings are a dark brownish red, and they have a smell that is a mix between death, roadkill, and sweet bread. If you like a challenge try them, my advice is eat as fast as you can because once you stop you’re a passenger at that point."

PainMatrix,"So pop music, which literally stands for popular music, has changed with the changing mediums. I grew up in the 80s with Madonna and Michael Jackson as a kid because that was what the top FM stations played. The internet in the past 20 years has provided a completely different venue with thousands of options making the concept of “popular” music obsolete except to younger and younger crowds who are just getting into music. Kids are into popular music regardless the genre because they are regularly interacting with each other as peers much more than adults because they’re around each other all day long. "

PainMatrix,"&gt; WHAT'S UNDETERMINED
&gt;The identities and demographic profiles of most perpetrators of mass shootings occurring between January and June 2018 are not readily available.

How is that even possible. When you read the article it says that about 1/3 were committed by blacks but none were committed by undocumented immigrants. Why the fuck not just make that the tag line then, no shootings this year were committed by undocumented immigrants? Seems like the truth should be sufficient to ruffle some neo-Nazi feathers. "

&gt;Ferrell: Yeah.

&gt;IGN: Please don’t do that!

&gt;Ferrell: See. That’s the thing. I don’t think either of us are ever on that side of ever wanting to rush into a sequel of things that we really care about. If you can figure that out and come up with a story that justifies having an extension of the first one, then great.

PainMatrix,"Weird to me this is 7 hours in and the question hasn’t been answered. I’m a psychologist with particularly expertise in sleep. There are 4 stages of sleep, REM, and then Non-R.E.M. stages 1-3. We move around quite a bit particularly during non-R.E.M. stage 2 where we spend most of our night. We don’t move at all (unless there is a disorder) during REM stage, otherwise we would act out our dreams. Our muscles actually go into a state of paralysis during this stage.

Anyway, I think the sleep trackers are bullshit because the level of movement during your sleep is not 100% correlated with the stages. "

My dad worked in the towers. I assumed he was there at the time (of course) and had to leave my college courses that day (for which I was later penalized for missing stuff on exams) to try to figure out where he was. 

Turned out he was in meetings in Jersey that day but lost a bunch of co-workers, people who kissed their spouses goodbye to go to what they assumed was a safe place. 

I sort of feel hopeful because of people like the teenager above you. It means that the collective psyche is resilient and optimistic. It’s a blessing and a curse for our species I think. "

PainMatrix,That’s not accurate. [Here’s the article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21688895/) which says that rats can be *conditioned* to like jazz using cocaine as a stimulus. It’s a conditioning study. Rats would just as likely be conditioned to like polka music or thrash metal if you give them enough cocaine.

PainMatrix,"They were working on a collaboration at the time but:

&gt; Unfortunately, the album was never finished due to the constraints of the two pop megastars schedules. Plus, the relationship between the two may have soured when (brace yourselves again) Michael Jackson insisted on bringing a llama into the recording studio. Unsurprisingly, Mercury was nonplussed by this behavior. According to an interview conducted with the Times of London, Queen’s former manager, Jim “Miami” Beach claims that Mercury called him and said, “Can you get over here? You’ve got to get me out of here, I’m recording with a llama.” Jackson was also reportedly less than thrilled with Mercury’s behavior during the recording session. According to the Hollywood Reporter, “Mercury subsequently fell out with Jackson because the U.S. star objected to Mercury taking too much cocaine in his living room.”"

&gt; We were in Vancouver, and it was always raining. I kept the door to my trailer open to smell the evening rain while I was watching a movie. Then I remember one day on the set—they let everyone pick their own clothes—there was one black actor who was also kind of a club kid. And he wore this shirt with the word “Garbage” on it in big stylish letters. It was his shirt. And Wesley came down to the set, which he only did for close-ups. Everything else was done by his stand-in. I only did one scene with him. But he comes on and goes, “There’s only one other black guy in the movie, and you make him wear a shirt that says ‘Garbage?’ You racist motherfucker!”

PainMatrix,"For anyone else like me that has no idea what’s going on:

&gt; The family of Iraq’s contestant in the Miss Universe Pageant have left the country due to threats to their lives over her modeling in a bikini and posting on social media photos taken with Miss Israel.

&gt;During the competition in Tokyo in November, Miss Israel, Gandelsman and Idan posed for photos on their respective Instagram accounts. Idan’s caption read: “Peace and Love from Miss Iraq and Miss Israel.”

&gt;Gandelsman told Hadashot news that Idan said she does not regret posting the photos.

&gt;“She did it to so that people can understand that it’s possible to live together,” Gandelsman said. “In order for people to see that we can connect, in the end we are both human beings.”

&gt;Idan has not removed the photo from her Instagram account. Last month she defended the photo in a post in Arabic on Instagram, the Times of Israel reported.

&gt;“I want to stress that the purpose of the picture was only to express hope and desire for peace between the two countries,” she wrote in the post. She said the photo does not signal support for the Israeli government and apologized if the photo was harmful to the Palestinian cause.

PainMatrix,Everyone is so fearful of losing their jobs by upsetting even part of their constituency.
PainMatrix,It means if they do that with you they should be keeping a very close eye on manic symptoms. The preferred approach would be something called sleep compression where they gradually restrict your sleep vs abruptly.

[deleted],[deleted]
PainMatrix,Too 5 at least from that show. 
PainMatrix,It’s based on the patients sleep diary and self reported sleep time. The wake up time is based on the patients circadian rhythm and schedule. The window is no less than 5 hours but I’ve also made it as much as 7 or 8 in rare circumstances. 
PainMatrix,"Incredibly so, the failures typically come about due to non-adherence to the prescription. Also, if you have a seizure disorder or history of bipolar you shouldn’t do sleep restriction. "
PainMatrix,I’m a clinical psychologist with particular experience in sleep and insomnia. I’ve administered and supervised CBT-I to hundreds of patients at this point. 
PainMatrix,"Yes, and I’ll tell you on average it’s about a week of breaking things down and then a week of building it back up. Plus, you’re generally getting the same amount of non-restorative sleep that you’re already used to so probably won’t feel much more tired than normal. "

PainMatrix,Yes unfortunately. They see his personality and behavior as a sacrifice for what they perceive as good economic policy (my mother in law has Fox News on in the background literally all day). It’s awful and she subscribed to all of the rhetoric and yet she is super nice. 
PainMatrix,"It has to be more complicated than that. It just has to be. My in\-laws, who are good people, voted for him.

The men, from the 2-502 Infantry's Attack Company were operating in Nalgham, in Zhari district. Two Americans and one Afghan soldier were killed in the attacks, four others, including Spc Moore, were wounded.

 
The troops are part of the 101st Airborne Division - known as the screaming eagles - sent to Afghanistan in June 2010 as part of Barack Obama's surge. Moore and his comrades paid tribute to their fallen as ""phenomenal soldiers"". They said the general public in America have no idea what is going on in Afghanistan.

PainMatrix,[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) are some more recommendations for you. 
PainMatrix,That list could be miles long. I recommend CBT-I and a consultation with your pcp to get back on track. 
PainMatrix,CBT-I (Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) is the first line recommendation of the AMA for insomnia and the most effective treatment there is. The nice thing about it is that it also targets stress/arousal symptoms. By the way your wife is definitely sleeping more than 1-2 hours per night. She's probably suffering from what we call sleep state misperception. When we're in the lighter stages of sleep (and particularly if we're stressed and tossing and turning) we have the perception that we're awake. 
PainMatrix,I 100% hear you :)
PainMatrix,The most common reason is you don't get up at the same time every day (including weekends). Example: if you get up during the week at 7 and then sleep until 10 on the weekends you create a 3 hour jet lag effect on your brain that throws off your internal sleep/wake clock. Try the same time every day for 2-3 weeks if you want to feel better and let I'd be curious to hear the results. 
PainMatrix,"about 7 hours. About 60% of people get between 7 and 8. Some need more, some need less. It's much more about the quality than the quantity. "
PainMatrix,"Sounds like you really may have delayed sleep phase. The key to consistent circadian functioning is consistent wake-time but in people with DSPD it's nearly impossible to get up during ""normal"" society hours. There's nothing dangerous about the condition except you're fighting your bodies own natural rhythms. About half of people with DSPD end up in 3rd shift jobs because of it. If you're looking to change things I'd consult your pcp and get a referral to a sleep clinic. What they would do is prescribe you melatonin and have you use a light-box in the morning. This will help, but unfortunately it will never be ideal. Hope this helps."
PainMatrix,absolutely! Sleep paralysis usually occurs when the brain has trouble shifting from REM sleep (where the muscles are relaxed and don't move) into a brief period of wakefulness. Nearly all drugs suppress REM sleep and will therefore further fracture that smooth transition. Glad to hear you're clean!
PainMatrix,"There could be a lot of reasons, but often it's d/t conditioning. If you're spending a lot of time in bed awake the brain starts to associate the bed w/ wakefulness and the mere act of getting ready for and into bed cues the brain to become more alert. The recommendation would be to get out of bed if you're awake for more than 15 minutes and do something else (this applies to beginning, middle, and end of the night). Eventually you'll become exhausted and your brain will begin to associate the bed w/ sleepiness and you'll sleep better. The other key is to keep a consistent wake-time that you stick with no matter what, that helps to regulate your brain's sleep/wake cycle."

PainMatrix,"&gt; Micke Ekvall seems to have gotten over it, though. The runner who was once saddled with the nickname ""bajsmannen"" (""poop man"") finished that 2008 race, the Göteborg half-marathon, in 21st place. In a post-race interview, a reporter asked him, ""Did you ever consider stopping to clean off?""

&gt;""No, I'd lose time,"" he explained, ""If you quit once, it's easy to do it again and again and again. It becomes a habit.""

&gt; The poop man, now 25 years old, has accomplished quite a bit since then. He ran the same race the following year, placing 9th. He went on to set a Swedish national record at the Copenhagen half-marathon in 2014, and represented Sweden at the European Athletic Championships."

PainMatrix,"&gt; Action T4 was the postwar designation for a programme of forced euthanasia in wartime Nazi Germany. Under the programme physicians were directed to judge patients ""incurably sick, by critical medical examination"" and then administer to these patients a ""mercy death"". In October 1939 Adolf Hitler signed a ""euthanasia decree"" backdated to 1 September 1939 that authorized Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler, chief of Hitler's private chancellery and Dr. Karl Brandt, Hitler's personal physician, to carry out the programme of euthanasia.
The programme officially ran from September 1939 to August 1941, during which 70,273 people were killed at various extermination centres located at psychiatric hospitals in Germany and Austria. Even after the official termination of the programme, physicians in German and Austrian facilities continued many of the practices that had been instituted under the programme until the defeat of Germany in 1945. This unofficial continuation of the Action T4 policies led to more than 200,000 additional deaths"

We're talking about the most popular and famous person in the known universe, and here I was, this goofy comedy songwriter. He not only returned our phone calls, but he approved it. He thought it was a funny idea. Then when we did the second parody, ""Fat,"" he was nice enough to let us use his subway set for the video, so he's always been very supportive.

The only song he requested Weird Al not parody was “Black and White” because he said “the message was too important. "

She was sentenced to only two-year prison term due to her short service in the SS and the defense claim that she did not kill anyone. After serving her sentence (cut in half by time spent in jail before trial) Kohlmann remained in Hamburg. She moved to West Berlin in 1965. On September 17, 1977 Kohlmann died in Berlin at the age of 56.

PainMatrix,"&gt;In spite of leaving his post the night Lincoln was shot, Parker was still assigned to work security at the White House. Before Mary Todd Lincoln moved out of the White House following her husband's death, Parker was assigned as her bodyguard. Mrs. Lincoln's dressmaker Elizabeth Keckley overheard Mrs. Lincoln yell to Parker, ""So you are on guard tonight, on guard in the White House after helping to murder the President.""[3] Parker attempted to defend himself stating that he ""could never stoop to murder much less to the murder of so good and great a man as the President. I did wrong, I admit, and have bitterly repented."" Mrs. Lincoln told Parker that she would always think he was responsible for the President's death and angrily dismissed him from the room.[3]"
PainMatrix,"&gt;It wasn’t until 1902 that the Secret Service, created in 1865 to eradicate counterfeit currency, assumed official full-time responsibility for protecting the president. Before that, security for the president could be unbelievably lax. The most astounding example was the scant protection afforded Abraham Lincoln on the night he was assassinated. Only one man, an unreliable Washington cop named John Frederick Parker, was assigned to guard the president at Ford’s Theatre on April 14, 1865.

&gt;In addition, officers will have to deal with ""house supervisors"" instead of nurses when they have a request. This will guarantee that nurses devote themselves entirely to patient care without interruptions, she said, while other officials deal with police requests.

This seems like good policy for dealing from the threats without but not the ones within. I work partly in a psychiatric emergency room and frequently get patients who are a threat to themselves and sometimes others. Without the assistance of our incredible in-house boys in blue we'd be in a lot of trouble. "

McPherson moved to Clearwater from Dallas in 1994 with her employer, AMC Publishing, a marketing firm operated and staffed largely by Scientologists. Like others at AMC, she wanted to be close to Scientology's spiritual headquarters in downtown.

A year later, McPherson, then 36, became ""clear,"" a state in which a Scientologist is said to be free of inhibitions caused by painful memories in the subconscious.

Two months later, just blocks south of Scientology's Fort Harrison Hotel, she was involved in a minor traffic accident. McPherson exited her sport utility vehicle, took off her clothes and told a paramedic, ""I need help. I need to talk to someone.""

Paramedics took her to nearby Morton Plant Hospital for psychiatric evaluation. Soon, fellow church members showed up and told hospital staff they would care for McPherson. Scientologists oppose psychiatric treatments. McPherson signed out against a doctor's advice and was taken to the Fort Harrison, where she remained for 17 days.

Handwritten daily reports written by low-level Scientologists painted a sobering picture. McPherson fought with her caregivers, refused to eat, cried and broke things. She soiled herself and eventually grew too weak to stand.

Church records show McPherson received doses of chloral hydrate, a prescription sedative, and was given magnesium injections.

The records also say McPherson was cared for by a medical doctor who is not licensed in Florida but worked for the church. The doctor diagnosed her as septic, determined she needed antibiotics and drove her to the hospital, the records said.

The staffers' notes indicated McPherson's weight had dropped dramatically and, one staffer wrote, she ""looked very sick and was breathing heavily.""

Still, they drove her to a hospital in the next county so she could be seen by a doctor who is a Scientologist. The trip took 45 minutes. At the hospital, McPherson was not breathing and had no heartbeat. The Scientologist doctor pronounced her dead.

* * *
Nearly a year after her death, State Attorney Bernie McCabe charged the Church of Scientology with two felonies: practicing medicine without a license and abuse of a disabled adult.

Those charges were dropped in June 2000 after prosecutors blamed then-Medical Examiner Joan Wood for scuttling their case.

Wood initially said McPherson had died of complications from dehydration. In 2000, five years later, Wood said that after reviewing her findings she determined the death was accidental.

But the civil case, in which the burden of proof is easier to meet than in a criminal cases, endured. Filed in February 1997 on behalf of McPherson's estate by Dell Liebreich of Texas, it contended church staff members let McPherson become severely dehydrated and ie.



JUNE 1995: McPherson becomes mentally disturbed and receives a Scientology procedure called the ""Introspection Rundown,"" in which a troubled person is placed in quiet, dark isolation. No one may speak within the person's hearing. The person is given vitamins and food and encouraged to rest. McPherson has trouble recovering, but later writes a letter praising church staffers for helping.

SEPTEMBER 1995: McPherson officially becomes ""clear,"" a state in which a Scientologist is said to be free of inhibitions caused by painful memories in the subconscious. Over 13 years, McPherson has spent tens of thousands of dollars on Scientology counseling. She is 36.

NOV. 18, 1995: McPherson is involved in a minor traffic accident in Clearwater, after which she takes off her clothes and tells a paramedic: ""I need help. I need to talk to someone."" She says she's been doing ""wrong things she didn't know were wrong."" Paramedics take her to nearby Morton Plant Hospital for psychiatric evaluation, but a group of church members intervenes. McPherson signs out against a doctor's advice and is taken to Scientology's Fort Harrison Hotel in downtown Clearwater.

DEC. 5, 1995: McPherson has been in the care of Scientologists at the Fort Harrison for 17 days. On the evening of Dec. 5, Scientologists caring for her worry she has become seriously ill. They decide to drive her to a hospital in New Port Richey - a 45-minute trip - so she can be seen by Dr. David Minkoff, a Scientologist who works in the emergency room. At the hospital, McPherson is not breathing and has no heartbeat. She is gaunt, bruised and unkempt, according to records. Minkoff pronounces McPherson dead.

DEC. 6, 1995: Clearwater Police quietly begin to investigate. There is no local obituary and no public police report on McPherson's death. News of the case would not leak out until a year later.

DEC. 16, 1996: When the investigation becomes public, Scientology accuses Clearwater Police of harassing the church. The church's version of the death: McPherson checked into the Fort Harrison hotel for ""rest and relaxation"" and ""suddenly fell ill.""

JANUARY 1997: The Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement join Clearwater Police in the investigation. Medical examiner Joan Wood tells reporters there is no way McPherson ""suddenly fell ill.""

FEB. 19, 1997: In Tampa, McPherson's relatives file a wrongful death lawsuit against the Church of Scientology.

JULY 9, 1997: New light is shed on the case when a judge allows the release of internal logs detailing how Scientologists cared for McPherson. The records differ significantly from the account church officials gave.

DEC. 15, 1997: Clearwater Police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement complete their investigation and recommend criminal charges in McPherson's death.

NOVEMBER 1998: After reviewing the case for 11 months, State Attorney Bernie McCabe charges the Church of Scientology with two felonies: practicing medicine without a license and abuse of a disabled adult.

NOVEMBER 1999: Wood agrees to reconsider her conclusions about McPherson's death.

JANUARY 2000: Robert Minton, a New England millionaire on a crusade to reform Scientology, opens a headquarters next to church property in Clearwater and calls his organization the Lisa McPherson Trust. Minton has financed the civil lawsuit against Scientology since 1997.

FEBRUARY 2000: Wood, after reviewing medical information provided by Scientology, changes McPherson's death certificate. She amends the manner of death from ""undetermined"" to ""accident.""

JUNE 7, 2000: His review complete, McCabe decides not to prosecute, noting that Wood's change of opinion undercuts the prosecution's effort to prove the criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt.

JULY 28, 2000: Hillsborough Circuit Judge James S. Moody Jr. orders the wrongful death lawsuit be transferred to Pinellas County.

NOVEMBER 2001: Minton announces the Lisa McPherson Trust is disbanding and closing its Clearwater headquarters.

APRIL 2002: In an astonishing reversal, Minton, who gave Ken Dandar, lawyer for the estate of Lisa McPherson, nearly $2-million to pursue the wrongful death suit, takes the stand for the church in its effort to remove Dandar from a case tied to the wrongful death suit.

JANUARY 2003: Circuit Judge Susan Schaeffer rules the wrongful death lawsuit against the Church of Scientology should continue, and that Dandar can remain on the case.

MAY 2004: The estate of Lisa McPherson and the Church of Scientology reach a settlement. The terms are made confidential. The "

PainMatrix,I think you're giving the person who stocked this vending machine far too much credit in thinking hot pockets should be frozen. I also think you could leave a hot pocket on the counter for 2 weeks and it would be no worse for wear. 
PainMatrix,"""Just say no to drugs.""

"".... I can say yes to them?"""
PainMatrix,DAE get annoyed when the poster puts the Tl:dr after the post instead of at the beginning? I ALREADY READ YOUR POST?!
PainMatrix,3.4 million for about 2+ years seems pretty decent. Context is everything. 
PainMatrix,Abuse aside he should also be fired as a gym coach for a fundamental misunderstanding of how the [human body works.](http://www.wusa9.com/amp/news/local/dc/the-splits-the-science-of-why-they-cant-be-forced/467373080)
PainMatrix,You find the things that mean the most to you and dive into them. Existential dread is pretty common btw. For fucks sake we're all going to die and that fucking sucks.

PainMatrix,"&gt;The Patriot missile battery at Dhahran had been in operation for 100 hours, by which time the system's internal clock had drifted by one third of a second. Due to the closure speed of the interceptor and the target, this resulted in a miss distance of 600 meters.

PainMatrix,Why not just read the comment? The first line is a platitude towards OPs post and then the rest of my comment talks about how politicians sometimes have to make difficult decisions that might make them look bad. 
PainMatrix,"&gt;You may disagree with him, but he does give a fairly cogent argument why that particular bill should have been rejected.

I literally said the same thing as you. Didn't you read my comment?"
PainMatrix,"&gt;With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, **to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations**.""

I wish we could all work a little harder at that part. "
PainMatrix,Bilbo Baggins is contesting it. 
PainMatrix,"Revenge is a dish best served cold I guess. 

That being said his argument was that [the bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy_relief_bill) was [""filled with pork""](http://www.nydailynews.com/amp/news/politics/ted-cruz-opposed-sandy-aid-bill-filled-pork-article-1.2239786) which is true. For example:

&gt;The bill also contains vast amounts of funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intended for repairs and upgrades of its facilities and equipment.

The point is that yes a lot of politicians are pieces of shit and should probably be voted out of office... but the system itself also sucks. This adding bills onto other bills thing is crap and Cruz was a victim of that. "
PainMatrix,Why is there a reference to the username being blank? Is something sketchy going on?
PainMatrix,I don't know that's why I'm asking you. This is /r/science and you're the one that posited the statement. Not trying to give you a hard time. 
PainMatrix,How well does it work to do that? Seems if anything it would create a strong bimodal response. What's the research on it?
PainMatrix,Not worth the rise in stress for me. I'm more a lover than a fighter. :)
PainMatrix,Reminds me of the time I got the results of my [audiology exam](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/File:Shrieking_book.gif)
PainMatrix,Smart. If she humanizes herself to them they're probably more likely to think twice before wreaking havoc. Either way she'll still probably be cleaning up a lot of puke. 
PainMatrix,My dad was a pro hockey player until I was 5. I have fond memories from that time. The main thing I remember actually is the administrative staff buying me ice cream :). Still good memories though. 
PainMatrix,I don't disagree at all. The smell of babies is intoxicating. There should be scientific studies surrounding it. That smell could be a way to wean hardcore drug addicts off of their drugs of abuse. It's one of the best things ever 
PainMatrix,"Same thing really. You ever taste little kid? I gnaw on my kids constantly, they're delectable. "
PainMatrix,"Meh, okay. I'm not gonna fight you on this anymore. I love my fellow redditors yourself included friend :)"
PainMatrix,Great. Now I can give my kids the same nightmares I had in the 80s. 
PainMatrix,Try reading my comment again. Obviously a lot of people who were alive 60 years ago aren't alive today war or not. 
PainMatrix,You guys all have a blinking eyelash on the back of your head?
PainMatrix,"It's amazing how much weight the first guy on the right lost. Also, there's only 8 guys on the right and 12 on the left. Shouldn't that be reversed?!"
PainMatrix,*meat
PainMatrix,So mainly healthy coping skills I guess. Impressive.
PainMatrix,Damn assault felony. Guess I'll be out in 2022 at least. 
PainMatrix,Whenever I make a fart sound I fart multiple times to makes sure the entire area smells as bad as possible. 
PainMatrix,"Welcome to uplifting news! I see this is your first time visiting. Over to your right we have the young girl whose entire family was crushed under a building but she managed to survive by drinking her own urine. 

And to your left is the young cancer patient who received a heart transplant and was predicted to die within a month but she survived for an entire three! 

Enjoy your stay!"
PainMatrix,After my time I think. Last time I was there was 98. Bob Dylan and Sonic Youth were highlights from what fragments I can remember :)
PainMatrix,Hopefully it wasn't a normal human mom birthing a giant. 
PainMatrix,Makes me think of any number of Calvin and Hobbes bits regarding [childhood imagination](http://i.imgur.com/WVisgB4.jpg)
PainMatrix,"Wow, this is a great idea that I'm thinking of using. My family's in the dildo business. "
PainMatrix,Go on....
PainMatrix,I assume Red Dawn was a post-eclipse apocalyptic biography. 
PainMatrix,"&gt;this is an old

Yes....."
PainMatrix,"No, because even the full picture looks the same. "
PainMatrix,That's what I was sort of thinking. For a turkey sandwich I [need this](http://i.imgur.com/acxv8HB.jpg)
PainMatrix,That bread to me doesn't at first glance look appealing. What is it?
PainMatrix,I divorced her on the spot obviously. 
PainMatrix,"Pack it up folks, we did it, we've solved the 'prejudice of immigrants' issue. "
PainMatrix,I lived abroad in Europe for a few years and went to international schools. Always a bunch of embassy kids there. One of my fondest memories was the Fourth of July water gun fights with the marines assigned there. They took no consideration to the fact that we were 10 years younger then them and absolutely annihilated us with super soakers and water balloons. Great memories. 
PainMatrix,Nobody tell Norel Pride's a sin. 
PainMatrix,"What a roller coaster of emotions afterwards:

&gt;But controversy ensued for the next 10 minutes or so.

&gt;After the Chinese Taipei manager came out to argue the call, the umpires gathered and overturned the call to a home run.

&gt;The Chinese Taipei batter rounded the bases and celebrated his home run with teammates as the Kennett Square crowd booed.

&gt;But the umpires again came together and changed the call back to an out."
PainMatrix,The skin under your eyes is thinner than in other areas so we can see blood vessels more easily. Fatigue and stress make you paler allowing the blood to be more easily seen. It can also be hereditary. 
PainMatrix,"&gt;N!xau had only had minimal exposure to modern life and did not see the value of money. However, by the time of sequel film The Gods Must Be Crazy II (1989) he had learned the value of money, and demanded several hundred thousand dollars before agreeing to be recast in the film. He insisted that the money was needed to build a cinder-block house with electricity and a water pump for his family comprising of **three wives** and their children.

Sounds like the guy ended up doing just fine. "
PainMatrix,All I see is a family playing a family disguised as another family.
PainMatrix,"Wow, that guy went went from 3 chins to 0 in 8 fake brush swipes. "
PainMatrix,Cool. Aesthetically interesting and useful.  Would probably buy. 
PainMatrix,"I just want to point out that 1981 seemed like a banner year for exotic pets biting humans. And that lion fish stabbing seems out of place in a story on bites.

Skunk bites human 1

Parakeet bites human 1

PainMatrix,I estimate my kids at around 5 million karma a piece. But those markets fluctuate vastly day by day. 
PainMatrix,"The day I see /u/dick-nipples espousing wholesome arts and crafts is well, Friday August 18th. Still a bit shocking. "
PainMatrix,"Yup, that was the joke. "
PainMatrix,Me?! I mean I guess my life **is** pretty shit but why'd you single me out?
PainMatrix,"Fuck man. You and me both. This is like supposed to be nice and cooly nostalgic but it only serves as a reminder to me of the cruel and inexorable forward movement of time. To quote one of my favorite poems;

&gt;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
&gt;Old Time is still a-flying;
&gt;And this same flower that smiles today
&gt;To-morrow will be dying.
&gt;The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
&gt;The higher he's a-getting,
&gt;The sooner will his race be run,
&gt;And nearer he's to setting.
&gt;That age is best which is the first,
&gt;When youth and blood are warmer;
&gt;But being spent, the worse, and worst
&gt;Times still succeed the former.
&gt;Then be not coy, but use your time,
&gt;And, while ye may, go marry:
&gt;For having lost but once your prime,
&gt;You may forever tarry."
PainMatrix,The best diarrhea I've ever had. 
PainMatrix,I like how all the way to the right guy regained his courage to take his shirt off after 30 years. It's idgaf age. 
PainMatrix,"Yeah, you win! And the episode was awesome!"
PainMatrix,"McDonald's French fries. Just listened to Malcolm Gladwells podcast and apparently the product was far superior prior to 1990. Prior to that the product was fried in beef tallow but they caved to a single activist on a saturated fat crusade. Would love to have tasted the fries, well I did but was too young to remember. "
PainMatrix,The mods removing this thread.

Let's not allow tiki torches to be co-opted in the same vein as the swastika. I love my tiki torches!"

PainMatrix,The neuroticism level seems very high on OP
PainMatrix,"That's part of what is great about this country. We protect those rights. Personally I love being an American but symbols like the flag mean nothing to me. I always think nationalism leads to jingoism, that's just my opinion. But again, protecting the ideas you dislike is at the cornerstone of democracy. "
PainMatrix,"&gt;of which 208 of the victims were black. 

Sorry, not South African, what does this mean? I get race has been a big thing in South Africa just wondering what the significance of this percentage of black victims vs white victims means in terms of the overall story.  

Edit. Downvoted? Why is this a strange question to ask why OP brought in race to a comment that seemed to have nothing to do with race. "
PainMatrix,Please don't call me surely. 
PainMatrix,"Yeah, [they did](http://i.imgur.com/cmfVfkE.jpg). Thanks FDR. Why would anyone think there wasn't a legal order? (Cue some inside joke I'm sure)"
PainMatrix,You think dick-nipples is fucking around?!
PainMatrix,I'd love that! :)
PainMatrix,I'm obviously not. What I meant was that every member of society that disagrees with the government should be sent to the Gulag. 
PainMatrix,"It's not gold though. How about, a one-carrot ring?"
PainMatrix,Ha ha? Obviously not. What I meant was we should have a guaranteed universal income.
PainMatrix,"I agree. But it doesn't seem to matter. What's the root cause here? It always seems to come down to being socioeconomically disadvantaged. How do we fix that, maybe a system where everyone earns the same amount?"
PainMatrix,I'll help you out. You're a voice of reason in an echo chamber of craziness. The vast majority of people are not new Nazis and this hasn't changed. I do think that a lot of this has been highlighted because of the current administration. 
PainMatrix,I'm Danish and I can verify it was spot on!
PainMatrix,That was fast. And disturbing. 
PainMatrix,What's that from?
PainMatrix,They were all sipping wine coolers after this photo was taken and they had an awesome wine cooler cascade from one to the other. Unfortunately the camera ran out of film and the moment wasn't captured. 
PainMatrix,"The main point of my comment was to link /r/mildlyinfuhrerating because it is so oddly and funnily specific. 

Edit. I'll edit my comment to get the main point across I guess. "
PainMatrix,He's also not a real nazi though either. Isn't it pretty clear he's just honoring both of these things. AND ISNT THAT BY ITSELF THE FUCKING GREATEST IRONY THAT THIS IS WHAT WE FOUGHT DURING WWII AND HE IDENTIFIES WITH THE ENEMY AND SHOULD'NT THIS BE THE ACTUAL THESIS OF THIS POST!

PainMatrix,I thought mine was pretty amusing. I mean the fact that there's a sub /r/mildlyinfuhrerating is pretty funny in and of itself.

PainMatrix,How can your life have gone so far amiss at the young age of 20 that you do something like this. 
PainMatrix,"Everyone does! Everyone occasionally has the thought ""what if I veered this car into this wall"" or ""what if I exposed myself in public"" and etc. People with anxiety are much more prone to buying into and believing those thoughts as facts. (I'm a psychologist btw)"
PainMatrix,"The fear of heights is common obviously and sometimes rooted in [the fear to jump:](http://www.nbcnews.com/health/body-odd/weird-urge-jump-bridge-explained-f424037)

&gt;Imagine a person with high anxiety sensitivity. She leans over a ledge of the Grand Canyon. In super fast reaction to her physical sensation of anxiety, her survival instinct forces her away from the edge. Yet when she looks at the ledge, she sees it’s sturdy. There was never any danger. Her brain tries to process an answer to the question “Why did I back up if it was safe?” A logical answer is that she must have been tempted to jump.
&gt;In other words, Hames explained, people misinterpret the instinctual safety signal, and conclude they must have felt an urge to leap."
PainMatrix,If bullets are flying right at them do a lot of people last more than 5 minutes?
PainMatrix,"Clinical psychologist here. I try to see the best in every person and I'd say after seeing several thousand patients only a couple of handfuls would stand out as being what I would describe as hopeless. All of them were either severely narcissistic or antisocial.

I guess the takeaway I want anyone reading this thread to have is that the vast majority of people are doing the best they can and are not bad people. "

PainMatrix,I think emotional support animals as well as service dogs can be great but to the reporter in that piece he was not about to have a panic attack. He was having an emotional reaction to describing trauma that this reporter in her fluff piece could never in their life ever understand. 
PainMatrix,Not surprising. His dad [invented the hamburger and is able to change the weather by just the power of his mind.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/8292848/The-Incredible-Kim-Jong-il-and-his-Amazing-Achievements.html)

PainMatrix,"&gt;36-year-old Naiphum Promratee visited the bear in the rural province of Phetchabun, Thailand, after hearing reports that it was hungry and the monks looking after it were asking for food donations.

&gt;But rather than feed it, Promratee hung bowls of rice above the beast using rope. Unsurprisingly, this annoyed the sh*t out of the bear who stood on its hind legs, got hold of him, and dragged him into the enclosure. The frustrated beast knocked Promratee unconscious and tore chunks off his flesh with its sharp teeth.

Fuck this guy and fuck the bears ""owners.""

Edit. Guy survived apparently. "

&gt;In Myers' own words (from a 2014 interview with Marc Maron):

&gt;An example of something I fought very, very hard for and it was my first movie, it was “Bohemian Rhapsody” in Wayne’s World. [The producers] wanted Guns N’ Roses. Guns N’ Roses were very, very popular, they were a fantastic band . . .
&gt;Queen, at that point, not by me and not by hard-core fans, but the public had sort of forgotten about them. Freddie [Mercury] had gotten sick, the last time we had seen them was on Live Aid and then there were a few albums after where they were sort of straying away from their arena rock roots. But I always loved “Bohemian Rhapsody,” I thought it was a masterpiece. So I fought really, really hard for it. And at one point I said, “Well I’m out, I don’t want to make this movie if it’s not ‘Bohemian Rhapsody.’”"
PainMatrix,You're right. [He was confined to a bed when he saw it](http://www.guitarworld.com/brian-may-wayne-s-world-bohemian-rhapsody-scene-hit-close-home/25749) but gave it a thumbs up. 
PainMatrix,Oxytocin is released during orgasm which can help reduce stress. Masturbation is usually the top answer on this reoccurring question which makes me think there are a ton of stressed out redditors on this site. Regular exercise is probably the best thing you can do people!
PainMatrix,There would still be a ton of leaders on a national level as well as local police and FBI. I fail to see how this would change things. 
PainMatrix,"Rule 1 my friend, the mods will remove this. Try /r/reactiongifs!"
PainMatrix,That would be primitive *modern* man

PainMatrix,"&gt;The only work open to women consists of tracing characters.

PainMatrix,"Yeah, but it wouldn't be ""Obamacare"", it would be, ""do you agree or disagree that employers should not be able to deny coverage to people for any reason,including health status,and from charging higher premiums based on health status and gender."""
PainMatrix,I'm a parent of young children who makes good money and your idea makes no sense. If you can't afford kids you shouldn't have them. 
PainMatrix,That's what I'm saying except the vote shouldn't be optional. You should be locked in to whomever you most closely match with. 
PainMatrix,Both. Love this idea too. My mom recently took and passed the naturalization test and became a citizen. I would love to see candidates taking this same test (without being given any warning of course) 
PainMatrix,"&gt;The extra time should also force people to think a little more deeply about what they are commenting on.

&gt;“If you spend 15 seconds on it, those are maybe 15 seconds that take the edge off the rant mode when people are commenting,” said Marius Arnesen, editor of NKRbeta.

I love this. Not that it's going to stop all trolls but if you actually have to put any kind of effort or thought into something people are more likely to take it seriously. "

PainMatrix,"My roommate and I /u/modok2000 had this idea 20 years ago during the 2000 presidential election. We should have an elementary quiz of basic knowledge of the candidates and their positions before being allowed to vote. Seems like it could solve a lot of problems. 

Edit. Damn; I just remembered the details of it and it wasn't exactly what I said. Here's what it was:

Election ballots shouldn't be people but a series of questions (asked orally if need be) about the issues:

""Do you agree with the NAFTA agreement"", ""Do you agree with Legalizing marijuana."" 

Your scores would then be matched up to the closest candidate that fits them and they would be the candidate that you blindly picked to run. 

It would take personality politics out of the equation completely!"

&gt;Amazingly, Coke agreed to share the list on the condition that Rabbi Geffen swear the formula to secrecy.

Though it was present in small enough amounts to technically meet kosher standards, Geffen decided that, since it was added intentionally and not as a necessary byproduct, he couldn’t sign off on certification. After hearing his ruling, Coke chemists set out to find a tallow substitute that would meet kosher standards without changing the taste. They honed in on a glycerin made from cottonseed and coconut oil that left both parties satisfied, and Geffen gave it his approval.

&gt;Born a slave in Richmond on July 11, 1863, Mitchell was appointed editor of the weekly paper in 1884 at the age of just twenty-one. He quickly gained a reputation as a man determined to expose racial injustice wherever it lurked. One writer described him as, ""dar[ing] to hurl the thunderbolts of truth into the ranks of the wicked."" ""No stronger race man is known among us,"" the adulation continued. ""Clinging to no party, subserving to no one interest save that of the oppressed, he throws the full force of heart and mind into every question that will affect...the welfare of his brethren."" [Freeman, (Indianapolis, Indiana, 8/30/1890)]

&gt;Under Mitchell, the Planet's masthead, the 'Strong Arm', was a flexed bicep surrounded by shock waves that radiated out from a clenched fist, reflecting the force and energy with which Mitchell projected his opinions. For forty-five years, the Planet covered news: local; national; and worldwide. Much of the paper's focus, however was on lynchings, segregation and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. Deterred by none, Mitchell's reports, editorials and cartoons denounced racial prejudice and ridiculed its perpetrators.

PainMatrix,Trejo was a criminal who served time and was rehabilitated. Given this I'm sure he doesn't judge others for their shortcomings and tries to see things from their perspective. He would probably think that from Tom Cruise's perspective he is trying to make the movie realistic and keep stunt people from being hurt. I think we'd all benefit from that kind of perspective-taking.

By the time you got to 5 or 6 it was totally unmanageable and everyone would just be talking over each other. "

PainMatrix,"The case was thrown out. But as far as the after effects:

&gt;Pepsi continued to air the commercial, but updated the cost of the Harrier Jet to 700 million Pepsi points.

&gt;The White House stated that the Harrier Jet would not be sold to civilians without ""demilitarization,"" which, in the case of the Harrier, would have included stripping it of its ability to land and take off vertically."
PainMatrix,"[Here's the ad](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZdackF2H7Qc) for those curious.

&gt;In justifying its conclusion that the commercial was ""evidently done in jest"" and that ""The notion of traveling to school in a Harrier Jet is an exaggerated adolescent fantasy,"" the court made several observations regarding the nature and content of the commercial. These included (among others) that:

&gt; - ""The callow youth featured in the commercial is a highly improbable pilot, one who could barely be trusted with the keys to his parents' car, much less the prize aircraft of the United States Marine Corps.""

&gt; - ""The teenager's comment that flying a Harrier Jet to school 'sure beats the bus' evinces an improbably insouciant attitude toward the relative difficulty and danger of piloting a fighter plane in a residential area.""

&gt; - ""No school would provide landing space for a student's fighter jet, or condone the disruption the jet's use would cause."""
PainMatrix,"I've been with my wife for 15 years and we have our own accounts and a joint one.

Maybe this didn't work for you OP and it may not work for everyone but we also do not ever fight about money. I just think that it depends on every couple and their unique situation what will or will not work for them. I don't think there's a one size fits all approach. "

PainMatrix,"They said steel rusts and I misread it?!

PainMatrix," The best thing you can do to raise the quality of your sleep is to not sleep in! Get up at the same time every day and that is the key to a good synchronized circadian rhythm.

PainMatrix,"We have no good treatments for you variable shift people I'm sorry!

PainMatrix,Get up. Don't lay in bed for more than 15-20 minutes. Do whatever (maybe not aerobic exercise but anything else) and go back to bed only when sleepy again. Repeat this as often as necessary until you've beaten sleep into submission. 
PainMatrix,"I have no long term concerns about the melatonin aside from tolerance. 

In response to your second question, get out of bed! The longer you lay in bed awake for the worse your insomnia will get. "
PainMatrix,"You're right, this isn't something I'm well-versed in or encountered. You just had me looking into sleep-bras, not sure if those might help?"
PainMatrix,Body temperature fluctuates throughout the night [take a look here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body_temperature#/media/File:Body_Temp_Variation.png).

PainMatrix,"Is it causing you any problems during the day? Is it disruptive to your overall functioning? If not, then no, it's not a problem. Sorry about your break-up!"

PainMatrix,"My honest advice is that if you're truly an insomniac then you are an expert at dealing with sleep deprivation. Remind yourself that it won't matter if you're not sleeping that night because you've had 1,001 other nights where you haven't slept and you still got things done the next day. The paradox of this reminder of course is that it takes the pressure off the brain to pay attention to time and sleep and sleep will come more easily. "

PainMatrix,"Most likely because it's conditioned. We do this with our children. They have their bath, get into their pajamas, and are read some books. Every night is the same. After a while, all of these become conditioned stimuli for sleep. "

PainMatrix,This is a phenomenon I'm familiar with but have little knowledge on. The part that is unusual in your case I believe is the compulsion to finish once you wake up (most people are fully asleep and aren't aware what they're doing). I'd advise you talk to a professional about this.

PainMatrix,"&gt;Unlike dogs, whose bodies and temperaments have transformed radically during the roughly 30,000 years we've lived with them, domestic cats are almost identical to their wild counterparts—physically and genetically. House cats also show none of the typical signs of animal domestication, such as infantilization of facial features, decreased tooth size, and docility.

Having cats myself I can attest to this but it depends on the cat. One of my cats will nuzzle and snuggle with me all night while the other only tolerates pets on his terms. "

My father was a captain for Eastern Airlines and told a story about almost being at takeoff speed when another commercial jet taxied across his runway. He was going too fast to abort so he had to pull up early and cleared the other plane by feet (don't remember the exact amount). His passengers had no idea but the other plane's passengers saw everything. I don't know what ended up happening to the other pilot, but my dad got an apology call from him that evening."

PainMatrix,"TIL Alexanders father was an elocution teacher and his wife was deaf. What a man to invent the telephone!

&gt;In that ringing declaration, I heard the clear diction of a man whose father, Alexander Melville Bell, had been a renowned elocution teacher (and perhaps the model for the imperious Prof. Henry Higgins, in George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion; Shaw acknowledged Bell in his preface to the play).

&gt;I heard, too, the deliberate enunciation of a devoted husband whose deaf wife, Mabel, was dependent on lip reading. And true to his granddaughter's word, the intonation of the British Isles was unmistakable in Bell's speech. The voice is vigorous and forthright—as was the inventor, at last speaking to us across the years."

PainMatrix,"I think it's a bit strange we give film critics so much credence. They should at least have demonstrated their own ability to create something amazing.

Edit. Apparently struck a nerve. I'll broaden this though. I don't think anyone should be allowed to be negatively critical on a professional level of something they can't do. I can't draw and would never wager a negative critique against that form of art. I can play music and have some more definitive opinions because of it. "

Okay, back with [this](http://imgur.com/Zl0ZEFh). Basically there are two different processes at play as far as sleep goes. The first, our sleep drive, builds from the moment we wake up. The second drive is our circadian clock which in part sends an arousal signal to our brain. The arousal signal basically takes a while to get going. That in part is the reason we're getting sleepier in the afternoon until we get our second wind. "

I drove all over that Sunday and after 4 hours found a microscope at a toy store that had 200x zoom. Unpackaged it, took out a slide and did the deed.... no motility.

PainMatrix,"[The info](http://www.designboom.com/design/nike-unlimited-stadium-manila-worlds-first-led-running-track-05-08-2017/)

&gt;in the center of manila, NIKE has constructed a pop-up arena that has been dubbed the ‘world’s first full-size LED running track’. taking over an entire city block, the layout of ‘unlimited stadium’ is derived from the footprint of NIKE’s LunarEpic running shoe. the 200 meter-track, which takes the form of a figure-eight, is lined with LED screens, where up to 30 runners can take part in a virtual race against themselves.

&gt;NIKE’s ‘unlimited stadium’ has been created by BBH singapore who conceptualized the overall project in collaboration with a team of partners. after setting an initial lap time, a sensor is attached to each athlete’s shoe, with their competing avatar running alongside them on the continuous LED screen. the avatars become larger the further and faster they run, encouraging runners to keep pace with their digital selves."

PainMatrix,"I can totally appreciate you asking and I'll tell you from at least my perspective. To me this one poem is about the innocence of childhood, how wondrous and beautiful things are before you get into the vulgarities of adulthood. To me Shel Silverstein did these poems in a way that young people got it on one level and adults got in on a total other level. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried when I read the Giving Tree to my kids.

&gt;There is a place where the sidewalk ends
&gt;And before the street begins,
&gt;And there the grass grows soft and white,
&gt;And there the sun burns crimson bright,
&gt;And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
&gt;To cool in the peppermint wind.

&gt;Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
&gt;And the dark street winds and bends.
&gt;Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
&gt;We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
&gt;And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
&gt;To the place where the sidewalk ends.

&gt;Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
&gt;And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
&gt;For the children, they mark, and the children, they know

&gt;Prior to the date he seemed normal. We texted and talked on the phone then arranged to meet at a restaurant/bar.
He was cute but definitely bitter about something. He was from California and apparently didn't like this new city we were in. He started talking about sex and blow jobs and complaining about how uptight everyone here is about sex.
He invited the waitress to a party his company was throwing, after sending back the French fries he ordered.
I showed him a picture of my dog on my phone; he took out his phone and showed me a picture of his penis.
We walked out of the restaurant together to get our cars from the valet. My car came first and I left. He texted me later that he had my sweater (apparently I dropped it on the way out) and if I wanted to see it again I'd have to hang out with him.
RIP, sweater."

PainMatrix,"Oh sorry, yeah, it's from the movie. The Armenian Genocide was an unbelievable atrocity though. "
PainMatrix,"&gt;In her memoir, Ravished Armenia, Aurora Mardiganian described being raped and thrown into a harem (which agrees with Islam’s rules of war).  Unlike thousands of other Armenian girls who were discarded after being defiled, she managed to escape. In the city of Malatia, she saw 16 Christian girls crucified: “Each girl had been nailed alive upon her cross, spikes through her feet and hands, only their hair blown by the wind, covered their bodies.”  Such scenes were portrayed in the 1919 documentary film Auction of Souls, some of which is based on Mardiganian’s memoirs."

PainMatrix,"[And it showed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain):

&gt;Charles did not learn to speak until the age of four nor to walk until eight, and was treated as virtually an infant until he was ten years old. His jaw was so badly deformed (an extreme example of the so-called Habsburg jaw) that he could barely speak or chew. Fearing the frail child would be overtaxed, his caretakers did not force Charles to attend school. The indolence of the young Charles was indulged to such an extent that at times he was not expected to be clean. When his half-brother Don Juan José of Austria, an illegitimate son of Philip IV, obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court, he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair."

&gt;Earlier this week, U.N. officials hung a blue curtain over a tapestry reproduction of Picasso's Guernica at the entrance of the Security Council. The spot is where diplomats and others make statements to the press, and ostensibly officials thought it would be inappropriate for Colin Powell to speak about war in Iraq with the 20th century's most iconic protest against the inhumanity of war as his backdrop. Why is Guernica such a powerfully controversial image after all these years, and how did it come to hang in tapestry form at the United Nations?"

PainMatrix,"I don't know the article and I've never heard of the journal before. Here was their finding:

&gt;Evidence for small-study effects was found in 72 meta-analyses, while 95 had evidence of excess of significant findings. Only 16 (7%) provided convincing evidence that psychotherapy is effective. These pertained to cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 6), meditation therapy (n = 1), cognitive remediation (n = 1), counselling (n = 1) and mixed types of psychotherapies (n = 7).

I'm not sure what their definition of ""convincing"" is but their paper says that nearly all of the papers they looked at had statistically significant findings favoring therapy. The other problem here is that they're just lumping many different types of therapy into one big pile as if they should all be equivalent. This is wrong as within our field we have ""evidence-based"" psychotherapies and many that are unsupported. CBT techniques are usually highly supported. "

&gt;They were very nice to do it, and I'm not sure they realized what they were doing until we got there. And then they were mad. But not mad enough to stop altogether. So they went through with it, and they were great."

PainMatrix,Obviously I must have made an error while spelling it. I can assure you I know how to spell intertwining... dammit!
PainMatrix,That would be a pretty complicated lie over something trivial that doesn't exactly give me an added benefit. 
PainMatrix,My phone autocorrected entertaining into intertwining. Instead of deleting and retyping it I just went in and replaced the 'w'. Probably should have just re-written it. 
PainMatrix,"I remember upvoting that thread, it was very intertaining. Have some more instant karma.

PainMatrix,One of the top comments in this thread already added a link to what a/h's sound like. 
PainMatrix,"Sorry, this is not my area of expertise. A general rule of thumb in my industry is if it doesn't cause dysfunction it is probably not an issue. "
PainMatrix,"This can't be real. A LPT that's getting upvoted is the idea of trying to not break a device by reflexively sticking your foot out? For real, what am I missing? How would reading this influence a reflexive response? Will someone's reflex be different after reading this?!"
PainMatrix,"I love that you said that. I've had 3 or 4 patients over the past year that wanted a ""check-up"" and were okay. I really like this on one level, that they're just checking in. On the other hand they're probably pretty anxious. "
PainMatrix,"From what I understand the answer is no. Autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia may share similar neurological pathways for the negative symptoms (think about the social aspects for example) but they are distinct, particularly with regard to the positive symptoms. "
PainMatrix,Actually I think with the advances in genetic testing and brain imaging that idea is moot. 
PainMatrix,"The people I see that fit this are usually early 20s which you're right is around when positive symptoms first usually manifest. What I typically see is a lot of very unusual thinking bordering on hallucinations (e.g. ""I can sense wavelengths in nature and feel what animals are feeling"" was a recent example). The more concerning symptoms as I mentioned in my previous comment are the ""negative symptoms"" which likely no one engaging on this post would have. "
PainMatrix,"I'm a psychologist but I don't work with SMI, so thank you for what you do. What I do see a lot of is what is likely a burgeoning schizophrenia spectrum process. My academic understanding is that the positive symptoms can be dealt with to some extent through medications but that it's really the negative symptoms (the blunted affect, poverty of speech, etc.) that are the most intractable. It's tragic. "
PainMatrix,"It's beyond horror or most people's ability to even comprehend. The fact that she was a fully functioning and intact human being at the early onset of her life and career and this disease completely derailed everything and locked her into a Sisyphus-like nightmare. Was this her first inpatient experience? How long were you with her, did the meds seem to have any positive impact on her?"
PainMatrix,"&gt;I see what you did there

Yeah, I think I'm good, thanks :)"
PainMatrix,You have no clue if they see fights all the time. Cheering is a completely different thing from laughter. You can't throw both into the same category. 
PainMatrix,"I'm not saying it's unusual and I'm certainly not condoning it. But think about the function of laughter, it's a response to discomfort or surprise. There's nothing inherently funny about two people fighting, people don't laugh at MMA events or boxing matches. The spectators to this fight were obviously uncomfortable about this on some level"
PainMatrix,"It must have been incredibly innocuous because I watched the movie with an eye for trying to spot it and I'm not even sure which scene it was. There was one scene when one of the Tom, Dick, and Stanley guys smiled when he was wearing a dress. And there was another scene where Gastons compatriot LeFou was dancing with another guy at the end. ~~A whole lot of do about nothing.~~ Much ado about nothing. 

Edit. Happy pedants?!"

&gt;From more than one source, he's emotionally stunted and has lived a very sheltered life. He has no sense of reality or what the world is like around him. He doesn't think the way we do or have any real friends to give him perspective. For him this is life."
PainMatrix,Maybe?
PainMatrix,"Yup, it's about [2:1](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM_People-Behind-DSM-5.pdf) psychiatrists to psychologists in the workgroups. As far as the power of the studies is concerned I think the biggest problem is the file drawer effect which is sort of what I think you're alluding to. I think this is a problem in many fields that needs to be corrected. 

Edit. why would you **want** to pick a fight?"
PainMatrix,"The DSM is consensus by committee based on meta-analyses, lit-reviews, etc. So, yes, statistical analysis is used. In fact, I would give our field some of the highest ratings in scientific tools used, it's just that our subject matter (i.e. people) is a soft and tough one. "

&gt;What are the most common problems/ disorders do you see? 

Adjustment disorders like the general population. PTSD is higher than the general population but probably actual PTSD cases are about 5%. 


&gt;Is there is a difference between the young guys (Iraq/Afghanistan) and the Vietnam era guys? 

Great question! Yes, the Vietnam guys in general came back and burned their uniforms and distanced themselves as far as possible from the military because of the way they were treated. These guys are the ones I on a personal level feel the most for for that reason. The younger guys coming back are across the board. Some are stoic and say they don't need help but for the most part they tend to be more receptive. 

&gt;I'm not in the military but I always wondered about PTSD sufferers ever being cured or better? Does it ever go away? Or is the goal just keeping it under control?

The goal is not to forget their trauma. But to not let it control them and not have it impact their functioning. And that is completely a reasonable goal. There are medications and therapies that we know work to help with this that help people move on!"

Pacific Creek parts at Two Ocean Creek and flows west. It meets up with the Snake River, then the Columbia River and flows into the Pacific Ocean.

PainMatrix,I'd be curious to see the link. Bedside manner is being given more of an emphasis in medical schools. I'm a psychologist and I think (at least historically) the medical community has minimized the importance of the human connection. This connection creates trust which increases likelihood of adhering to recommendations and creates a placebo response that bolsters immune functioning. 
PainMatrix,I knew how important bedside manner was (in real life most people wouldn't want to have House as their doctor) but was surprised that people would trust medical recommendations about equivalently from a friend/family member as a doctor.

&gt;I had done this for 30 years, and I had never wanted to be a puppeteer in the first place. I wanted to be a journalist, and really what I wanted to do was direct theatre and direct movies. As an actor and a performer, you feel limited because you're not the source for the creation, and I wanted to be the source... I've always enjoyed, more than anything else, bringing things to life, whether it be characters or actors in a scene or moments in movies. I've done so much with puppets, that I've wanted to work with actors. "
PainMatrix,I guess it depends on your perspective. $25 is how much I used to spend on just a single concert ticket. Two movie theater tickets seems like a bargain in comparison.

&gt;The storyline is crazy actually. These guys have a whole storyline of how he gets the Mohawk. The whole story’s crazy. These guys came with the script, I’m like, “You guys wrote this?” Not only did they write this, they did the musical in their college. They were going to go off Broadway with it and then they lost their insurance and they came to Hollywood. If anyone saw their play it’s that, but the newer version is pretty intense. They added more action. I never saw the play but I think they added more backstory to Rufio, like how he became Rufio which I was impressed by. It’s in development """

PainMatrix,"&gt;Houdini died on Halloween in 1926. His wife Beatrice (Bess) offered $10,000 to anyone who could produce an authentic message from the spirit of her husband. Every Halloween for the next ten years she held a séance, hoping in vain for Houdini's spirit to turn up.*  Fletcher, the reverend Ford's ""spirit guide,"" claimed to get the message 'forgive', not from Houdini but from Houdini's mother, on February 8, 1928. Bess wrote Ford that her husband had ""awaited in vain all his life"" for that word from his mother (Christopher 1975: 126). However, Ford's message need not have come from the spirit world since Bess had told a reporter for the Brooklyn Eagle in 1927 that Houdini had longed to hear from his mother and that any authentic communication would include the word 'forgive' (Christopher: 126)."

PainMatrix,"Theories about this per /u/backgrinder:

&gt;There is truth to this. Caligula had a legion nearly mutiny when he tried to order them to invade Britain, when things settled out he declared war on the sea and ordered them to collect seashells from the beach as ""war trophies"". There are three theories on why he did this:
&gt;Theory #1: Caligula was batshit nuts. This theory is used to explain any behavior attributed to him by either good sources or his enemies.
&gt;Theory #2: Caligula was such a scheming, lying, no good manipulative bastard that he gathered seashells, called them booty and declared and celebrated a nonexistent victory because he knew the good people of Rome were so terrified of him they would agree to anything he said just to keep him from killing them.
&gt;Theory #3 Caligula was a brilliant and ruthless politician, and after his legions shied away from an invasion in order to humiliate them he ordered them to collect seashells from a beach like a bunch of little kids since that was all the victory those weaklings could claim for themselves anyways.
&gt;Theories 1 and 2 have been very popular for a very long time. Theory 3 is currently being debated a bit. Personally, I tend to fall in for theory #3. I have always felt the claims of Caligula's insanity were a little too over the top to be believable, and were likely a combination of vicious rumours spread by his enemies after he died, and misunderstandings of actions he took which were symbolic but very real statements in his rivalry with the Senate.
&gt;If you want to hear the case made for #3 in detail the book Caligula by Aloys Winterling does this. It is a good read, and offers a pretty good picture of Caligula as a brilliant man fighting a no holds barred political fight. Winterling doesn't get the last word here, and some legitimate arguments can be made against this books conclusions, but it is still a very good alternate theory that shouldn't be lightly dismissed imo

&gt;It had to do with a young black man who had been kidnapped and brutally murdered by two members of the Ku Klux Klan.
The Klansmen, Henry Hayes and Tiger Knowles, slit the victim's throat and hung his body from a tree.

&gt;They carried out the attack in retribution for a jury acquitting a black man in the slaying of a white police officer. As Sessions learned that some members of the Klan had smoked marijuana on the evening of the slaying, he said aloud that he thought the KKK was: ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" Sessions insists he was joking. But the damage was done.

PainMatrix,"[Semantic satiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation):

&gt;The explanation for the phenomenon is that, in the cortex, verbal repetition repeatedly arouses a specific neural pattern that corresponds to the meaning of the word. Rapid repetition makes both the peripheral sensorimotor activity and central neural activation fire repeatedly. This is known to cause reactive inhibition, hence a reduction in the intensity of the activity with each repetition. Jakobovits James (1962) calls this conclusion the beginning of ""experimental neurosemantics"".

In eli5 terms our brains can't keep interpreting the same stimulus at the same intensity because it gets tired. And that's when things get weird. "

PainMatrix,"&gt;On May 1, 1969 Fred Rogers, host of the longtime children's television landmark Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, appeared in Washington before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications to express his disagreement with a proposal by President Richard Nixon to cut federal funding for public broadcasting from $20 million to $10 million. He addressed subcommittee chairman Senator John O. Pastore by outlining his submitted testimony, stating that ""one of the first things . . . a child learns in a healthy family is trust, and I trust . . . that you will read this. It's very important to me."" Rogers continued to detail the emotional impact that television had on children and how the medium could be used to provide a guiding influence to them. He said that his program's entire budget of $6,000 was equal to the cost of ""less than two minutes of cartoons,"" referred to by Rogers as ""animated . . . bombardment."" Over the course of Rogers' passionate yet respectful testimony, Senator Pastore's gruff demeanor slowly softened. The chairman even said that, though he was ""supposed to be a pretty tough guy,"" Rogers' fervent plea had given him ""goosebumps."" Pastore effused: ""I think it's wonderful. I think it's wonderful,"" and, after a slight pause, he made his conclusion clear: ""Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars."" More than forty years later, Fred Rogers’ compelling words about the power of television to help children grow up, dealing sensibly and humanely with others even when they are feeling angry, still resonate in living rooms, school rooms, and neighborhoods nationwide."

PainMatrix,I don't doubt or not doubt. See my comment just below [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5nm8wq/massive_scientific_report_on_marijuana_confirms/dccninx). I'm interested in good science answering good questions. 
PainMatrix,"I think there are a few things going on:

1) yes, marijuana probably is efficacious at helping certain symptoms and conditions,

2) the placebo effect is a real thing and people do really feel better if they think what they're taking is helping, even if it's a sugar pill, 

3) people like to get high and will use the medicinal value as a justification. 

Ten years from now when marijuana is federally legal (hopefully), all of this will be sorted out. "

Article title is a tad misleading.

Findings remained statistically significant at 1-year follow-up in 60% of the sample.""

I also wonder how much of this difference is due to the Action and Fantasy facets of the ""Openness to Experience subscale. In other words, subjects that were exposed to a chemical that was novel and different had a positive experience that would make them more open to other new imaginal experiences. Here are the 6 facets:

1. Fantasy: receptivity to the inner world of imagination

2. Aesthetics: appreciation of art and beauty

3. Feelings: openness to inner feelings and emotions

4. Actions: openness to new experiences on a practical level

5. Ideas: intellectual curiosity

&gt;People often discount evidence that contradicts their firmly held beliefs. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms that govern this behavior. We used neuroimaging to investigate the neural systems involved in maintaining belief in the face of counterevidence, presenting 40 liberals with arguments that contradicted their strongly held political and non-political views. Challenges to political beliefs produced increased activity in the default mode network—a set of interconnected structures associated with self-representation and disengagement from the external world. Trials with greater belief resistance showed increased response in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and decreased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex. We also found that participants who changed their minds more showed less BOLD signal in the insula and the amygdala when evaluating counterevidence. These results highlight the role of emotion in belief-change resistance and offer insight into the neural systems involved in belief maintenance, motivated reasoning, and related phenomena."

&gt;the leading edge of the owl’s wing has feathers covered in small structures (hooks and bows) that break up the flowing air into smaller, micro-turbulences. These smaller areas of turbulence then roll along the owl’s wing toward the trailing edge, which is comprised of a flexible fringe. This fringe breaks up the air further as it flows off the trailing edge, resulting in a large reduction in aerodynamic noise. Then, any remaining noise that would be detectable by the owl’s prey is absorbed by velvety down feathers on the owl’s wings and legs. These soft feathers absorb high frequency sounds that most prey, as well as humans, are sensitive to."

PainMatrix,"From /u/talenphllips:

&gt;On May 1, 1969 Fred Rogers, host of the longtime children's television landmark Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, appeared in Washington before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications to express his disagreement with a proposal by President Richard Nixon to cut federal funding for public broadcasting from $20 million to $10 million.
He addressed subcommittee chairman Senator John O. Pastore by outlining his submitted testimony, stating that ""one of the first things . . . a child learns in a healthy family is trust, and I trust . . . that you will read this. It's very important to me.""
Rogers continued to detail the emotional impact that television had on children and how the medium could be used to provide a guiding influence to them. He said that his program's entire budget of $6,000 was equal to the cost of ""less than two minutes of cartoons,"" referred to by Rogers as ""animated . . . bombardment."" Over the course of Rogers' passionate yet respectful testimony, Senator Pastore's gruff demeanor slowly softened. The chairman even said that, though he was ""supposed to be a pretty tough guy,"" Rogers' fervent plea had given him ""goosebumps."" Pastore effused: ""I think it's wonderful. I think it's wonderful,"" and, after a slight pause, he made his conclusion clear: ""Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars.""
More than forty years later, Fred Rogers’ compelling words about the power of television to help children grow up, dealing sensibly and humanely with others even when they are feeling angry, still resonate in living rooms, school rooms, and neighborhoods nationwide."

PainMatrix,"Loach's response [in this straight dope message board](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=703849) on this question was pretty good:

&gt;I can certainly not answer for every department across the country. I can only say what happens in my department. 

&gt;The officer does not write his own accident report. I'm sure that is true throughout the state. Here a supervisor is dispatched to take the report. An accident report is an official document. Putting something on the report that isn't true is a felony. It would also be a charge of Official Misconduct which could have a sentence of 5 years. Trying to cover up something as minor as an accident just isn't worth it. Especially someone else's accident. Of course the accident will also be recorded by the dash cam so its usually easy to tell who is at fault. I don't know about where you work but here the bosses have no problem telling us when we did something wrong. 

&gt;In fact we are held to a higher standard. We have a periodic accident review board. They when they look at our accidents they don't look at if the officer was at fault. They look to see if the accident could have been avoided. So the other driver could have been at fault officially but the officer still gets a reprimand for not avoiding the accident. 

In either situation, obviously you as the taxpayer is paying for it. "

He performs his routines during gymnastics competitions for comic relief, wearing a skirted leotard and often calling himself Paulina Huntesque, Pauletta Huntenova, Paulette Huntinova or some similar variation. Often he would sport his thick mustache.

Open air schools or schools of the woods were purpose-built educational institutions for children, that were designed to prevent and combat the widespread rise of tuberculosis that occurred in the period leading up to the Second World War. The schools were built on the concept that fresh air, good ventilation and exposure to the outside contributed to improved health.
The schools were mostly built in areas away from city centers, sometimes in rural locations, to provide a space free from pollution and overcrowding. The creation and design of the schools paralleled that of the tuberculosis sanatoriums, in that hygiene and exposure to fresh air were paramount; open air schools however also provided education."

PainMatrix,"Beginning in the 1870s, Germany was an economic power house under Otto Von Bismarck. The US was equally divided around that time. There's always a better time and there's always a worse time, because that's how the pendulum swings. When people look back, as in ""make X great again,"" my feeling is they only look back at living generations they've experienced. "
PainMatrix,"I counted it up once. I've had 27 distinct jobs. So, speaking from some experience here, there are jobs that are ""I just need money jobs"" and there are ""this is my passion and I want to make this my career"" jobs. The employers of the former know this and in no interview I had for one of those jobs did the reason for me applying ever come up (e.g. pizza-delivery, landscaping, cleaning (all jobs I had at one point)). When you have a job from the latter category, this is a totally different beast and you will passionately be able to speak about the answer."

&gt;“This gives you vigor and vitality,” he exclaimed.

&gt;After a short time Tesla warned Twain that he better come down now or risk the consequences.

&gt;“Not by a jugfull,” insisted Twain, “I am enjoying myself.”

&gt;Continuing to extol on the wonderful feeling for several more minutes Twain suddenly stopped talking. Looking pleadingly at Tesla he yelled:

&gt;“Quick, Tesla! Where is it?”

&gt;“Right over there,” Tesla responded calmly. Off Twain rushed to the restroom, embarrassed by his condition. Tesla smiled; the laxative effect of the vibrator was well known to the chuckling laboratory staff."

He had noticed that the Luck board did not rely on luck at all, but was actually running in five predictable patterns -- which he memorized over the course of six weeks, with the help of a VCR. By the time the show's taping was completed, everyone from the host to the contestants were mystified by Larson's amazing ability to avoid the Whammy (the squares on the board which would end the player's turn) and consistently win prizes. For Larson, there were indeed ""No Whammies."""

PainMatrix,"Description:

&gt;Once the male finds a suitable mate, he bites into her belly and latches on until his body fuses with hers. Their skin joins together, and so do their blood vessels, which allows the male to take all the nutrients he needs from his host/mate’s blood. The two fish essentially become one. 

&gt;With his body attached to hers like this, the male doesn't have to trouble himself with things like seeing or swimming or eating like a normal fish. The body parts he doesn’t need anymore—eyes, fins, and some internal organs—atrophy, degenerate and wither away, until he’s little more than a lump of flesh hanging from the female, taking food from her and providing sperm whenever she’s ready to spawn.

PainMatrix,"LPT. Have kids, then you won't even have the expectation of sleeping in and you won't be disappointed. "
PainMatrix,"Alcohol does a few things that fuck up sleep. It suppresses R.E.M. sleep and interferes with the overall architecture of the different sleep stages. In addition, as it withdraws from your body it also has a stimulating effect on your body that inhibits deep and quality sleep. The research shows that you should drink no more than 2 drinks for a guy or 1 drink for a gal close to bed if you want to avoid this. "
PainMatrix,Have to put it in context for the time. She was turned on to socialism in part because the working class was especially prone to maltreatment and physical injury (including blindness) in the course of their labor. Factory conditions were pretty tough for industrial workers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It's interesting because every time he talks about healthcare now it still sounds like universal healthcare, although I don't think he's called it that. Certainly goes in a different direction from the GOP base on that.

PainMatrix,"Judy Garland was abused her entire career, the Wizard of Oz was just the beginning of it which is below. She was also totally taken advantage of and maligned during her variety show, which was essentially what broke her, see /u/homaseckusyl's [account of it here](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/491kns/judy_garland_delivers_a_stunning_performance_on/d0okitc)

&gt;From the very beginning, studio executives were worried that Judy Garland was too fat to play a happy-go-lucky Kansas farm girl, so in an effort to prevent her lumbering, gelatinous ass from literally sinking the production, they put her in a corset and shoved amphetamines down her throat hand over fist. She was 16 at the time, but this was the 1930s, when forcing children into meth addiction was standard Hollywood practice. As opposed to today, where it's totally different. (We use prescription pills now.)

&gt;MGM executive Louis B. Mayer was so committed to making sure Garland got down to an acceptable weight that he had people follow her around to make sure she wasn't cheating on her diet. That diet, by the way, consisted of chicken soup, coffee, and ... 80 cigarettes a day. Holy fuck, 1930s.

&gt;Garland's co-stars didn't treat her any better, either. The actors who played the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Wizard refused to even talk to her between takes, insisting that they were serious actors and resented playing second fiddle to a woman. Even on screen, they would attempt to shove her to the back of the scene like a bunch of schoolyard bullies. Ironically, the only friend she made on set was Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked 

&gt;Director Victor Fleming was an utter bastard, too. Garland had an unfortunate habit of laughing at Bert Lahr's (Cowardly Lion) antics during filming, so Fleming would have to occasionally take her into the back and slap the humor out of her. The fucking Land of Oz is no place for whimsy"

PainMatrix,"His inspiration from his book ""On Writing"":

&gt;One day, Harry [the other janitor] and I were supposed to scrub the rust-stains off the walls in the girls' shower. I looked around the locker room with the interest of a Muslim youth who for some reason finds himself deep within the women's quarters. It was the same as the boys locker room, and yet completely different. There were no urinals, of course, and there we two extra metal boxes on the tile walls--unmarked, and the wrong size for paper towels. I asked what was in them. ""Pussy-plugs,"" Harry said. ""For them certain days of the month.""
I started seeing the opening scene of a story: girls showering in a locker room where there were no U-rings, pink plastic curtins, or privacy. And this one girl starts to have her period. Only she doesn't know what it is, and the other girls--grossed out, horrified, amused--start pelting her with sanitary napkins... The girl begins to scream. All that blood! She thinks she's dying, that the other girls are making fun of her even while she's bleeding to death... she reacts... fights back... but how?
I'd read an article in LIFE magazine some years before, suggesting that at least some reported poltergeist activity might actually be telekinetic phenomena--telekinesis being the ability to move objects just by thinking about them. There was some evidence to suggest that young people might have such powers, the article said, especially girls in early adolescence, right around the time of their first-- POW.

PainMatrix,"&gt;The United States provided $6.5 billion in military assistance to Cairo between 2011 and 2015 with the understanding that it would be closely monitored and it would serve American interests. Instead, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) asserts that the Obama administration has often failed to meet those requirements due to resistance from their Egyptian counterparts, lack of guidance from Washington and insufficient staffing at the US Embassy in Cairo

Fucking typical government spending and reporting and there's neither a media outcry or an outcry from the US citizenry. "

PainMatrix,"conclusion:

&gt;Associations between added sugars and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among US children are present at levels far below current consumption levels. Strong evidence supports the association of added sugars with increased cardiovascular disease risk in children through increased energy intake, increased adiposity, and dyslipidemia. The committee found that it is reasonable to recommend that children consume ≤25 g (100 cal or ≈6 teaspoons) of added sugars per day and to avoid added sugars for children &amp;lt;2 years of age. Although added sugars most likely can be safely consumed in low amounts as part of a healthy diet, few children achieve such levels, making this an important public health target."

They have for example tried stopping a grease fire by water, and they tried to fill the entire house with water. The hosts are comedians so it's pretty amuzing.

Twice he hurled back grenades which had fallen on his trench, but the third exploded in his right hand, blowing off his fingers, shattering his arm and severely wounding him in the face, body and right leg. His two comrades were also badly wounded but the rifleman, now alone and disregarding his wounds, loaded and fired his rifle with his left hand for four hours, calmly waiting for each attack which he met with fire at point blank range.

PainMatrix,"&gt;A Golden Orb Weaver (Nephila edulis) is sedated with carbon dioxide gas, and pinned around her limbs and abdomen, keeping her in place without causing any harm. Silk is pulled by tweezer from the spinnerets and attached to the spool with a dab of glue after which the motor is started to begin harvesting. The silk produced here consists mainly of major ampullate silk which forms the main structure of the web (like scaffolding) and minor ampullate silk, which is used to form the main spiral of the spider's web. Nephila edulis females can produce up to six different types of silk.
It's possible to harvest between 30-80 metres of silk in one go, after which the spider can be released back to its web to feed ready for reeling another day.

&gt;He gave beggars huge ingots, overpaid at bazaars and tipped with fistfuls of gold dust. Musa also reportedly ordered a new mosque built for him to pray at every Friday. In addition, he made formal charitable donations of 20,000 ounces of gold – 1,250 pounds – each at Cairo, Mecca, and Medina.

&gt;The instantaneous and incalculable influx of gold into Cairo, Mecca, and Medina caused hyperinflation the likes of which had never been seen before or since and nearly impoverished all three great cities for over ten years. Assuming roughly equal distribution of the total gold load across all those aforementioned camels, Musa made at least 71,000 pounds of gold basically worthless by just plumb giving it away into climates that considered it scarce and valuable. This means in terms of gold devaluation alone the damage Musa’s pilgrimage caused amounted to $1.5 billion in modern money.

PainMatrix,"
&gt;My biggest worry is that I'll start the job and I'll hate having to listen to similar stories of how people lost their minds through sz/DID etc and developing relationships with these people will send me crazy (not literally but you know what I mean). Question is does your job weigh you down psychologically yourself?

Yes. I do a lot to keep myself healthy including talking with colleagues, exercising, eating well, etc. But I do get burnt out occasionally. 


&gt;Also, have to ask: do you like the money? How much more than you do your senior consultants make and how long would it take you to become a senior consultant?

I don't know what you mean by consultant? I make $100,000. It's good money, but money was never the end all be all for me.

&gt;Thirdly, how different is your job to health psychologists? I was thinking of doing this too.

I'm actually a clinical **health** psychologist which means I had extra training in understanding and treating the link between medical and psychological issues. 


&gt;Lastly, do you find that most of your clients are on the whole normal other than their underlying disorders or do you have many that are absolutely off their rocker? Thanks.

I don't work with serious mental illness so no ""off their rockers."" Most people have primary mental health diagnoses and are just normal people in pain. Some patients do have personality disorders and those are probably the bane of my existence as they're not looking to improve on anything for the most part. "

And there is always another hurdle: GRE, grad school applications and interviewing process, masters thesis, qualifying exams, internship applications and interviewing, doctoral dissertation and defense, post-doc applications and interviewing, the licensing exam, and finally actually applying and getting a job!"
PainMatrix,"Clinical psychologist here. It's great, I'm doing something really gratifying and I feel like I'm making a difference helping people. 

But, the journey to get here was tough. There is more and more competition for decent graduate school and internship positions and the process is long and arduous. If I had to do it again I honestly don't know if I would.

Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time.

PainMatrix,"From /u/wexmanmtl:

Atmospheric scientist here. It seems there are two issues with the plan.
1) The meteorology of it. The study being done by UCAR (an extremely well respected organization) is interesting and completely legitimate. Lots of research has been done on quantifying effects of mountains on precipitation. Depending on several factors, precipitation over, downwind, OR upwind of a mountain peak tends to be higher than the other directions. The characteristics of the mountain and stability of the atmosphere are important here.
They're modeling different sized mountains in different locations. There are probably some locations that tend to have for example easterly or southerly winds all year. If they built a west-east oriented mountain, southerly winds would hit the mountain, rise up, the air would cool as it rises, and would condense into a cloud (like how dew forms as the ground cools). They mention cloud seeding, which involves putting chemical particles which act as cloud condensation nuclei into the cloud, which are necessary for the drops to grow large enough to become raindrops. Cloud seeding does work, but studies into the amount of precipitation it produces have had mixed results. It seems the UAE would want at least a few more inches of rain annually. That could be doable, but I'm not sure.
2) The feasibility of building a sufficiently large mountain. Yeah. Not so sure about this part. To affect local precipitation patterns the mountain/hill would probably have to be at least 100-200 ft high but also perhaps a mile wide. Again, UCAR is apparently studying the configuration and that'll play a role in whether or not Dubai goes forward with the plan.
Overall, far-fetched but not completely ridiculous plan in terms of the science. If anyone were to build a mountain, it would probably be the UAE."

The thing is that the feeling that ""our generation was right and this new generation is a bunch of degenerates"" goes back to antiquity.

&gt;According to the Smithsonian Institute, the first-ever dog to earn a military rank really earned it—alerting sleeping troops to a gas attack, helping medics find injured soldiers, and even discovering a German spy: ""Stubby"" … caught a German soldier mapping out the layout of the Allied trenches. The soldier called to Stubby, but he put his ears back and began to bark. As the German ran, Stubby bit him on the legs, causing the soldier to trip and fall. He continued to attack the man until the United States soldiers arrived.”

PainMatrix,"I'm personally wondering if he's neglected Step 3.  From How Stuff Works, the 4 steps to creating Stockholm Syndrome:

1. In a traumatic and extraordinarily stressful event, a person finds herself held captive by a man who is threatening to kill her if she disobeys him in any way. She may be abused - physically, sexually and/or verbally - and having trouble thinking straight. According to the captor, escape is not an option. She will end up dead. Her family may end up dead, too. Her only chance at survival is obedience.

2. As time goes on, obedience alone may become less of a sure thing - the captor is under stress as well, and a change in his mood could mean harmful consequences to his prisoner. Figuring out what might set off her captor's violence so she can avoid those triggers becomes another survival strategy. In this way, she gets to know her captor.

3. A minor act of kindness on the part of the captor, which can include simply not killing the prisoner yet, positions the captor as the prisoner's savior, as ""ultimately good,"" to quote young Anne Frank's famous characterization of the Nazis who ultimately led to her death. In the traumatic, life-threatening circumstances in which the prisoner finds herself, the slightest act of kindness - or the sudden absence of violence - seems a sign of friendship in an otherwise hostile, terrifying world, and the prisoner clings to it for dear life.

4. The captor slowly seems less threatening - more an instrument for survival and protection than one of harm. The prisoner undergoes what some call an act of self-delusion: In order to survive psychologically as well as physically - to lessen the unimaginable stress of the situation - the prisoner comes to truly believe that the captor is her friend, that he will not kill her, that in fact they can help each other ""get out of this mess."" The people on the outside trying to rescue her seem less like her allies. They are going to hurt this person who is protecting her from harm. The fact that this person is also the source of that potential harm gets buried in the process of self-delusion"

&gt;I’m not sure how to segue into this, so I’ll just come out and ask. You’re a Scientologist, right?
&gt;I am, yeah.

&gt;Do you celebrate Christmas? I’ve never been sure about that. Does Christmas count as a Scientology holiday?

&gt;Oh yeah. We absolutely celebrate Christmas.

&gt;So you have a tree with ornaments and eggnog and presents and Christmas carols that aren’t about Xenu?

&gt;I’m a Christian! I think there’s so much confusion because people don’t understand a religion where you can be another religion but you can still practice Scientology. That’s why it’s completely progressive. It’s just tools for living. It’s about understanding one’s self and others and compassion and how to communicate better and how to live in this troubled society. It’s really basic, common sense stuff. It has nothing to do with all this funny folklore that surrounds it. You could be a Jewish Scientologist or a Buddhist Scientologist or a Christian Scientologist or anything else.

&gt;Do you believe your ancestors were reincarnated aliens?

&gt;That’s not been a part of my experience, no. (Laughs.)

&gt;So... you don’t believe you came from aliens?

&gt;I was thinking about where that idea came from, and I was like, “Oh, maybe it’s because [L. Ron] Hubbard was a successful science fiction writer, so they’re confusing his science fiction with his other studies that have nothing to do with science fiction.” It’s like you thinking I might punch somebody in the face because I played somebody who punched somebody in the face in a movie.

That’s when it becomes scary, when you have people trying to take away other people’s right to practice a religion of your own choosing."

PainMatrix,"The reason Braveheart is reviled by many scots is largely due to the films historical inaccuracies. For example:

&gt;The film's depiction of the Battle of Stirling Bridge lacked any kind of, well, bridge. And its view of the English led to accusations of 'toxic Anglophobia'."

Thus, an adolescent is likely to think that everyone else (the imaginary audience) is just as concerned with him as he himself is; while at the same time, this adolescent might believe that he is the only person who can possibly experience whatever feelings he might be experiencing at that particular time and that these experiences are unique to him."

As the Estonians attacked the Danish stronghold, the Danes were hard pressed. Anders Sunesen, the Archbishop of Lund, raised his hands to the sky in prayer, and the defenders held tight as long as his hands were raised. As Archbishop Sunesen became exhausted, he eventually had to lower his arms, and the Estonians were on the verge of victory. Then, a red flag with a white cross fell from the sky, and gave the Danes the victory. "

A manic episode is defined in the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual as a period of seven or more days (or any period if admission to hospital is required) of unusually and continuously effusive and open elated or irritable mood, where the mood is not caused by drugs/medication or a medical illness (e.g., hyperthyroidism), and (a) is **causing obvious difficulties** at work or in **social relationships** and activities, or (b) requires admission to hospital to protect the person or others, or (c) **the person is suffering psychosis.**

To be classed as a manic episode, while the disturbed mood and an increase in goal directed activity or energy is present at least three (or four if only irritability is present) of the following must have been consistently present:

1.Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity

2.Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after 3 hours of sleep.)

3.**More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.**

4.Flights of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

5.Increase in goal directed activity, or psychomotor acceleration.

6.**Distractibility (too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli).**

7.Excessive involvement in activities that have a high degree for painful consequences.(e.g., extravagant shopping, sexual adventures or improbable commercial schemes)."

&gt;The thing is, according to Bradbury, you know, the guy who wrote the book in the first place, it isn’t about censorship, like at all. Though Bradbury did indeed write the book during an era when actual book burnings were a thing that totally could have happened at any moment, he has always insisted that the main theme of the book is the role of the mass media and its effect on the populace, in particular television and how it makes people less able to digest more complex forms of media, like books."

PainMatrix,"&gt;A valet at a five-star hotel in the Indian capital caused $335,000 worth of damage to a Lamborghini Gallardo after crashing it into a concrete wall in front of horrified guests, a report said Thursday.
A photograph of the aftermath at Le Meridien hotel, published in the Times of India newspaper, showed the severely crumpled front end of the sleek white supercar with its hood forced up.
“The car had been parked by valets a number of times before,” distressed driver Nipun Miglani told the newspaper, saying he had borrowed the Italian-made speedster from a friend and driven to the hotel last Thursday.
He has filed a police case against Le Meridien, which has refused to accept responsibility, as well as the valet, named as Arun Kumar. He claims the repairs have been estimated at 20 million rupees ($335,000).
CCTV footage apparently showed the valet bring the car from the parking area to the porch of the multi-storey hotel, which hosts several glitzy restaurants and a bar, and then briefly get out.
After climbing back behind the wheel, he then lurches forward inexplicably, sending a colleague diving for cover before piling head-on into the wall, injuring himself in the process.
The rear-wheel-drive Gallardo, named after a type of fighting bull, is capable of a top speed of around 200 miles an hour (321 kilometers an hour) and has an engine packing more than 550 brake horsepower.
It sells in Europe for around $250,000 but import duties on supercars normally double their price in India."

People who hoard are incredibly attached emotionally and in other ways to the things they accumulate. My theory on this is that the disorder becomes so difficult to extinguish because it's constant repetitive reinforcement over years and years and years. Any way, even with counseling and medications we're usually not able to help. It usually involves a therapist going in to the home as well as a garbage receptacle outside the home and family involvement. It really takes a village. "

She walks in beauty, like the night 
Of cloudless climes and starry skies; 
And all that’s best of dark and bright 
Meet in her aspect and her eyes; 
Thus mellowed to that tender light 
Which heaven to gaudy day denies. 

One shade the more, one ray the less, 
Had half impaired the nameless grace 
Which waves in every raven tress, 
Or softly lightens o’er her face; 
Where thoughts serenely sweet express, 
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. 

And on that cheek, and o’er that brow, 
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, 
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent, 
A mind at peace with all below, 
A heart whose love is innocent!"

Near this Spot
are deposited the Remains of one
who possessed Beauty without Vanity,
Strength without Insolence,
Courage without Ferocity,
and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.

This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery
if inscribed over human Ashes,
is but a just tribute to the Memory of
Boatswain, a Dog
who was born in Newfoundland May 1803
and died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808


When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,
Unknown to Glory, but upheld by Birth,
The sculptor’s art exhausts the pomp of woe,
And storied urns record who rests below.
When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen,
Not what he was, but what he should have been.
But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,
The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
Whose honest heart is still his Master’s own,
Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
Unhonoured falls, unnoticed all his worth,
Denied in heaven the Soul he held on earth –
While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.

Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,
Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power –
Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,
Degraded mass of animated dust!
Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,
Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!
By nature vile, ennobled but by name,
Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.
Ye, who behold perchance this simple urn,
Pass on – it honours none you wish to mourn.
To mark a friend’s remains these stones arise;
I never knew but one -- and here he lies."

&gt;We obtained a bovine larynx from a local slaughter house (no animal was harmed or killed specifically for this purpose). After fixing the larynx in a horizontal position to a piece of wood and closing the distal end using tissue paper, 750 g of pure lead (around 450°C) was heated until melting and then poured into the larynx. Immediately, large amounts of steam appeared at both ends of the specimen, and the clot of tissue paper was expelled with force by the steam. Within 10 seconds, the lead had congealed again, completely filling the larynx.

&gt;Having molten lead or gold poured down your throat, they conclude, is a pretty sure way to die: it might rupture your organs, burn your lungs and choke you. Ultimately, though, it's probably the steam that pulls the plug. "

&gt;if you’re ever unlucky enough to get hydrofluric acid on your skin, it doesn’t actually hurt until a few hours later. After it has absorbed a bit, it starts destroying your nerves and bones and can ultimately cause cardiac arrest when it gets into your blood stream. In fact, in 1994 a lab technician in Australia accidentally spilled hydrofluric acid on his lap and despite immediately executing safety procedures including hosing off, immersing himself in a swimming pool, and later extensive medical care (including needing to have one of his legs amputated), within two weeks of the accident, he was dead."

PainMatrix,"Hey, so I'm a behavioral sleep expert. The brain spends about 10 minutes (on average) in stage 1 sleep and about 20 minutes in stage 2 sleep. Once it hits stage 3 sleep, the circadian drive starts to be thrown off and adenosine levels start to be diminished. That's why ""power"" naps are less than 30 minutes.  "
PainMatrix,"Since your caveat is ""purely from a quality of sleep perspective"" then absolutely it's a better option. The thing that's difficult to weigh it against is the relationship factors that also improve overall health and well-being. My recommendation often when doing sleep restriction therapy with a patient who feels like they need to go to bed when their spouse is going to bed is to go to bed with them and spend some time cuddling, having sex, or other forms of intimacy if that's important to them, and then get out of the bed. Same could be said for separate beds."
PainMatrix,The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has [guidelines on this](http://www.aasmnet.org/resources/practiceparameters/csa.pdf) and CPAP's are still the recommendation and have been shown to help.
PainMatrix,"For longer naps, but a power nap (&amp;lt;30 minutes) has been shown to have health benefits. "

If you're just feeling the ""afternoon slump,"" that's normal and has to do with the way our body's circadian rhythm and sleep drive syncs up. Additionally if you're eating foods high in sugar content (that includes carbs) for lunch then you're likely going to be dealing with low energy when those sugar levels drop. "

PainMatrix,"An important caveat is there are regional and sociodemographic differences that get lost in the averages:

&gt;The decline in religious commitment was most pronounced among men, Whites, and those in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, and was nearly absent among Black Americans and small in the South. It appears that groups with relatively high social power are less likely to see themselves as having a significant need for religion or God in recent years."
PainMatrix,"Weird that more Americans believe in an afterlife if all the other things have gone down. The authors speculation on the finding seems a bit afield:

&gt;One plausible, though speculative, explanation is that this is another example of the rise in entitlement—expecting special privileges without effort (Campbell, Bonacci, Shelton, Exline, &amp; Bushman, 2004; Twenge &amp; Foster, 2010). Entitlement appears in religious and spiritual domains when people see themselves as deserving spiritual rewards or blessings due to their special status. Entitlement centered on afterlife beliefs could be seen as a modern rendition of Pascal’s wager, in which the individual observes that believing in God and a positive afterlife has few downsides, but not believing has the major possible downside of condemnation to eternal suffering (Hájek, 2003). However, the current data make it difficult to determine the cause of rising belief in the afterlife."

As a result the Keys were paralyzed: visitors canceled reservations, deliveries were delayed or stopped, and attractions suffered tremendous loss of business. Something had to be done.

&gt;From the early 1980s, Heimlich advocated malariotherapy, the deliberate infection of a person with benign malaria in order to treat ailments such as cancer, Lyme disease and (more recently) HIV. As of 2009 the treatments were unsuccessful, and attracted criticism as both scientifically unsound and dangerous.[23] The United States Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have rejected malariotherapy and, along with health professionals and advocates for human rights, consider the practice ""atrocious"".[24][25] The Heimlich Institute, a subsidiary of Deaconess Associations of Cincinnati, conducted malariotherapy trials in Ethiopia, though the Ethiopian Ministry of Health was unaware of the activity. Reportedly the trials were supervised by Mekbib Wondewassen, an Ethiopian immigrant who works as a car rental agent in the San Francisco area. Heimlich claims that his initial trials with seven subjects produced positive results, but refused to provide details.[23] The experiments had no institutional review board oversight."

&gt;More than 100 former Philadelphia Eagles cheerleaders will join a lawsuit against 29 National Football League teams, charging that visiting players peeped on them in a Veterans Stadium locker room, their lawyer said.

&gt;The suit charges that the players spied on the women as they showered and changed through holes in a door and cracks in walls that separate the visitors' and cheerleaders' locker rooms, and through scratches in a painted window.

&gt;The suit alleges that the activity took place between 1983 and this year and that it was common knowledge among many players. The ""ability to peer into the cheerleaders' locker room, and to view them in (various) states of undress, was considered one of the special 'perks' of being a visiting team of the Eagles,"" the suit said.

&gt;""It was common knowledge among virtually the entire National Football League — while at the same time a carefully guarded secret to be known only to the players and other team employees of the (visiting) teams — that these conditions existed,"" the suit states."

PainMatrix,"&gt;Hydrogen peroxide is one of the more controversial sources of wound antiseptics, mainly because its effectiveness in usage continues to be debated today. It’s also still one of the most commonly used solutions for wound irrigation and trying to rid fresh injuries of infection. However, more studies continue to accumulate indicating that hydrogen peroxide is not only ineffective when it comes to aiding overall wound healing stages, but can also slow down the entire process. The bubbling on the wound surface common when hydrogen peroxide is applied is believed by many to be caused by the solution attacking bacteria within the lesion, when in fact it’s also damaging your own cells in the process. Simply using a safer solution, such as saline, can provide moisture and help cleanse an injury without risk of cell damage."
PainMatrix,"There are tons of examples of technology moving faster than law. This is another one. Thomas Jefferson:

&gt;The boats normally have steel rails welded to their hulls that ride along the metal bleacher looking things when the boat is set free. After the launch these are obviously removed. However …. with this boat design, they were unable to attach these steel rails and had to use wooden ones instead. I have a friend that works for the shipyard and basically someone made a huge misjudgement and the wood split and flew everywhere, as you can obviously see from the video.

PainMatrix,"I'm not sure [what to believe:](http://www.modelt.ca/faq-fs.html)

&gt;It is often quoted that Ford chose black because the paint dried faster than other colored paints available at the time, and a faster drying paint would allow him to build cars faster as he would not have to wait for the paint to dry. This theory is not supported by fact however.

&gt;The fact is that over 30 different types of black paint were used to paint various parts of the Model T. The different types of paint were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the different parts, and had different drying times, depending on the paint and the drying method used for a particular part. Ford engineering documents suggest that the color black was chosen because it was cheap and it was durable. Common sense tells us that Ford, being a pragmatic man building a very practical car, certainly would have chosen black for this reason."

At the time of his death he was studying for his ASE Master Mechanic Certification through Allegany College of Maryland. Joshua worked as a Veterinary Technician for Wahconah Veterinary Services in Hinsdale. He also enjoyed working as a handyman. An avid thrill-seeker, his passion was tricking, a form of [gymnastics], and he also enjoyed hang gliding, scuba diving, and skydiving.

Do I not want a gun-toting flag-burner who hates abortion and gay marriage? Do I not want a gay marriage supporting liberal who wants to burn all the guns and wants free health care for everyone?"

PainMatrix,"Ted Cruz's was asked that recently on NPR. His response frankly shows a lack of understanding of the scientific process while at the same time he also makes ad hominem attacks against both politicians and scientists that argue that climate change is real:

TED CRUZ: Well, I believe that public policy should follow the science and follow the data. I am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers and scientists. In the debate over global warming, far too often politicians in Washington - and for that matter, a number of scientists receiving large government grants - disregard the science and data and instead push political ideology. You and I are both old enough to remember 30, 40 years ago, when, at the time, we were being told by liberal politicians and some scientists that the problem was global cooling...

INSKEEP: There was a moment when some people said that.

CRUZ: That we were facing the threat of an incoming ice age. And their solution to this problem is that we needed massive government control of the economy, the energy sector and every aspect of our lives. But then, as you noted, the data didn't back that up. So then, many of those same liberal politicians and a number of those same scientists switched their theory to global warming.

INSKEEP: This is a conspiracy, then, in your view.

CRUZ: No, this is liberal politicians who want government power over the economy, the energy sector and every aspect of our lives.

INSKEEP: And almost all the countries in the world have joined in to this approach?

CRUZ: So let me ask you a question, Steve. Is there global warming, yes or no?

INSKEEP: According to the scientists, absolutely.

CRUZ: I'm asking you.

INSKEEP: Sure.

CRUZ: OK, you are incorrect, actually. The scientific evidence doesn't support global warming. For the last 18 years, the satellite data - we have satellites that monitor the atmosphere. The satellites that actually measure the temperature showed no significant warming whatsoever.

INSKEEP: I'll just note that NASA analyzes that same data differently. But we can go on.

CRUZ: But no, they don't. You can go and look at the data. And by the way, this hearing - we have a number of scientists who are testifying about the data. But here's the key point. Climate change is the perfect pseudoscientific theory for a big government politician who wants more power. Why? Because it is a theory that can never be disproven."

There was a radio call in station when I was growing up in the 90s that was all about calling in requests for love songs for significant others (I called one in for the woman who became my wife but that's a different story). When I was in high school I called in a request for Lady in Red by Chris De Burgh for my 1-month anniversary with my sophomore year girlfriend (trust me I'm literally cringing as hard as I can just writing this). Her last name was Baron but I had heard it as ""Bacon"" and it was repeated on the radio as such... She killed me and my entire family over it and now we're obviously dead so yeah, it is a big deal. "
PainMatrix,"Yes, hallucinations are typically only seen in severe depression. "
PainMatrix,"A bunch of people have asked about this so I figured as a psychologist I should probably respond. Depression with psychotic features is a pretty well recognized phenomenon. Although I obviously don't know anything about her in particular and there may be more to her, the depression could have been sufficient enough for that to happen "
PainMatrix,"Her suicide note to her husband is heart-breaking, she was in serious distress. It's believed that she would have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder if she had been alive today. 

&gt;Dearest,

&gt;I feel certain I am going mad again. I feel we can’t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan’t recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can’t concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don’t think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can’t fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can’t even write this properly. I can’t read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that – everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can’t go on spoiling your life any longer.

&gt;I don’t think two people could have been happier than we have been."

PainMatrix,"&gt;depression lies

I agree, that is a decent way to encapsulate it. Depression makes you think there is no hope, no future, that things are immutably and eternally bleak and that you're all alone. I work with people with depression and get to see them overcoming it on a daily basis. There is hope for sure. "
PainMatrix,"It may have been white, but it was most decidedly not sugar. "

&gt;The white stuff the ribbon worm ejects from its mouth is its proboscis, which it everts – turns inside out – from a chamber located just above its mouth when it attacks its prey. It does this by rapidly filling up the proboscis with fluid it stores in the chamber. The sticky tentacles of the proboscis then shoots out and acts like a net to grab hold of and immobilise prey.

&gt;After the strike, a muscle inside the worm pulls the proboscis back into the chamber, effectively shoving whatever it’s ensnared into its mouth.

PainMatrix,My clinical experience in dealing with people with antisocial personality disorder is they often are able to put words to feelings but in a very clinical way and not with any depth.

PainMatrix,"Dubbed the ""Borghild project"":

&gt;Hitler gave Himmler’s plan the all-clear, and designers set to work creating a smaller-than-life doll dubbed a “gynoid.” Designers approached Hungarian actress Kathe von Nagy and asked if they could model the silicone doll on her. She refused. That inspired them to leave the doll’s face blank: they reasoned that soldiers were more likely to use the “comforters” if they could impart their own fantasies on them. Just in case the men needed a bit of inspiration, the Nazis gave their creation blue eyes and blond hair.

&gt;After extensive testing Himmler ordered 50 dolls for his own troops. But by 1942 the party leadership had pulled the cord on the project. Embarrassed soldiers refused to carry the “comforters,” and officers worried that their men would be mocked if captured by the enemy.  American and British forces likely destroyed the gynoid factories  during their bomb raids of Dresden.

PainMatrix,"When I was 14 I went on a class ski-trip. I went down a slope that felt like this at the time but was like a quarter of the difficulty. I got to the bottom and my kinda new girlfriend asked me how it was. I said ""I felt like I was going to pee my pants,"" without even thinking. She broke up with me like 2 days later but I'm sure this is why, I don't even blame her. "

PainMatrix,"Based on the EEOC definition of sexual harassment it doesn't seem to fit if this was just your first time. Sounds like she's an easily offended person and HR probably just didn't know what else to do with you.

Sexual harassment:

&gt;Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
&gt;Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
&gt;Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted)."

PainMatrix,"The news story, translated, from the last time this was posted:

""When the video began, the middle-aged man had just caressed the young lady's thigh. The bus was parked by the side of the road, and judging by the sound, the video was filmed by a young man. The middle-aged man was about to leave the bus (after allegedly touching the woman) when he was informed that the authorities has been called already.

The woman: 'You wait, I tell you, not everyone on the bus is for you to touch, you gotta see clearly who you're touching... you've never seen a woman before? You're a pervert... ' The man also attempted to retort but was stopped each time.

Suddenly the woman stands up, still yelling, when an uniformed man stepped into the bus and without a moment's hesitation kicked the middle-aged man's head. Another male passenger immediately tries to calm the uniformed man down, as the uniformed man yelled threats of ""I'll kill you"". The middle aged man holds his head in pain, appearing to be very upset, and tries to stand up twice, each time being persuaded to remain sitting.

By the end of the video, the middle-aged man apologizes repeatedly (I guess he was fine), but the woman refuses to accept said apologies, insisting to wait for the police to handle the issue."""

PainMatrix,"&gt;Gay activists and their supporters were unhappy with the way in which he targeted gay sex and the risk of infection through anal sexual intercourse as primary vectors of the disease, but Koop was unapologetic, claiming such activities entail risks several orders of magnitude greater than other means of transmission. Religious activists, upset over the pamphlet's frank discussion of sexual practices and advocacy of condom use, called for Koop's resignation. Koop also infuriated some former supporters by advocating sex education in schools, possibly as early as the third grade including later instruction regarding the proper use of condoms to combat the spread of AIDS. 

If you're pissing off both liberals and conservatives you're probably doing something either really progressive or really stupid. Koop was a progressive though and did some wonderful work on education surrounding the negative effects of tobacco use as well, including the dangers of second hand smoke. "

PainMatrix,"[For anyone curious](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/why_are_chicken_eggs_different_colors) about why chicken eggs come in different colors. Aside from the color there are otherwise no differences:

&gt;All eggs start out white in color; those that are laid in shades other than white have pigments deposited on them as the eggs travel through the hen’s oviduct. The journey through the chicken’s oviduct takes approximately 26 hours. The shell takes roughly 20 hours to be complete. Ameraucana birds have the pigment oocyanin deposited on the egg as it travels through the oviduct. This pigment permeates the egg shell resulting in the interior and exterior of the egg being the same blue color. Chickens that lay brown tinted eggs deposit the pigment protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of forming the shell. The pigment therefore does not penetrate the interior of the egg, but tints only the surface of the egg, which is why brown eggs are white on the interior. In the case of an Olive Egger, a brown pigment overlays a blue egg shell resulting in a green egg. The darker the brown pigment the more olive color of the resulting egg."

1.  The most epic one was when the senior class a few years before me got a Volkswagen bug into the cafeteria and filled the cafeteria with 4 inches of sand and did a whole beach theme with umbrellas. 

2. The year before me just trashed the school and smeared shit on the chalkboards, not cool. 

Since senior pranks were banned our year (because of the shit-smear year) we did a senior skip day which was going to an amusement park. It was 3 hours away and when we got there we found out it had been closed down for a couple of years. This was when the Internet hadn't really gotten big by the way. Man, was that a let-down.

People with this disorder struggle to fit in to society's schedule and many end up working 3rd shift (it's estimated as many as 60% of third shift workers meet criteria for this). "

PainMatrix,"There are a couple of really interesting questions in there. The first, is it ethical to prescribe a placebo?

- From the AMA: ""Physicians may use [a] placebo for diagnosis or treatment only if the patient is informed of and agrees to its use.”

- and from the NEJM: ""Outside the setting of clinical trials, there is no justification for the use of placebos.”

As a professional and a clinician I would be hard-pressed to think of an occasion where I would ethically be okay with outright misinforming a patient about the benefits of a specific treatment. However, your mother is already in the midst of this treatment and she feels it's working so it's at the very least having a positive psychological effect which in and of itself has a medically healing effect. The balance of the money and potential risk are ones that both you and /u/smeeee have considered.

Now your second question: Would ""divulging the placebo"" ruin the benefit. The answer, surprisingly, is [""maybe not.""](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201101/placebo-even-when-you-know-its-fake). A study from Harvard with IBS patients that compared patients who would be given no treatment versus patients who were told they would be given a sugar pill demonstrated that those given the placebo did significantly better with their symptoms at follow-up.

PainMatrix,"Hey /u/smeeee, it's been a little while!

I also agree with /u/humandrinkingtea's response. I wrote up a post on Habit Reversal Therapy over in /r/behavioralmedicine that could be helpful:

&gt;Habit Reversal Therapy is a multi-component therapy that has been shown to be effective [above and beyond](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735811000754) just trichotillomania to treating a wide variety of what we would call ""habit disorders.""

&gt;I think the site is behind a paywall so here are the relevant sections of what the treatment involves (There are 5 main components): 

&gt;Awareness training is based on the premise that increased awareness of behavior facilitates self-control ( Piacentini &amp;amp;amp; Chang, 2005). A client is taught to discriminate each occurrence of the habit, including the environmental antecedents that precede its manifestation. Awareness training components include: (a) response description: identification of occurrences surrounding performance of the target behavior, (b) response detection: self-observation and diary monitoring of the topography, frequency and severity of target movements, (c) early warning: focusing on the sensations preceding behavior onset, and (d) situation awareness: acknowledgement of high-risk situations for the target behavior.

&gt;Relaxation training is based on the premise that increases in stress lead to increases in habit behaviors ( Piacentini &amp;amp;amp; Chang, 2005). However, some experts have noted that the effects of relaxation training on the occurrence of target behavior have not been observed to generalize outside treatment sessions ( Adams et al., 2008 and Piacentini and Chang, 2005).

&gt;Competing response training has the aim of rendering performance of the undesirable behavior impossible due to the use of antagonist muscles to the behavior ( O'Connor, 2005). This antagonistic response serves to normalize the behavior by replacing it with a less conspicuous action. Azrin and Nunn (1973) proposed that the competing response should (a) be opposite to the target behavior, (b) be able to be maintained for several minutes ( Woods &amp;amp;amp; Miltenberger, 1995), (c) produce heightened awareness of the behavior though muscle contraction, (d) be socially inconspicuous, (e) be compatible with normal activity, and (f) should strengthen the muscles antagonistic to the target behavior ( Piacentini &amp;amp;amp; Chang, 2005). Competing responses include the following: For tics, isometric tensing of muscles opposite to the tic movement ( Azrin &amp;amp;amp; Peterson, 1990); for stuttering, breathing slowly, deeply, and regularly, relaxing chest and throat muscles, and speaking upon exhaling ( Waterloo &amp;amp;amp; Gotestam, 1988); for thumbsucking, clenching both fists with the thumb inside ( Christensen and Sanders 1987). Adams et al., 2008 and Miltenberger, 2008 describe other competing responses for various repetitive behavior disorders.

&gt;Motivation training techniques are used to enhance the acceptability of HRT to children and their families ( Piacentini &amp;amp;amp; Chang, 2005) and to encourage treatment compliance. The three standard motivational techniques are (a) a habit inconvenience review that involves identification of the impairments, problems and discomforts caused by the habit, (b) social support training involving the recruitment of a person in the client's life to provide encouragement and support (e.g., prompts to use the competing response) in order to aid implementation of the procedures ( Woods, 2006), and (c) public display, involving public performance and demonstration of the client's control of the target behavior.

&gt;Generalization training involves symbolic rehearsal in which the client imagines successful control in situations identified during the awareness stage ( Adams et al., 2008, O'Connor, 2005 and Woods and Miltenberger, 1995). With each situation the client imagines beginning the target behavior, stopping the behavior, and performing the competing response ( Miltenberger, Fuqua, &amp;amp;amp; Woods, 1998

&gt;He got his idea on his wedding night in 1953, when a champagne cork struck him in the left eye, which eventually became blind. The blinking of his eye led him to wonder if he could make windshield wipers that worked the same way -- that would move at intervals instead of in a constant back-and-forth motion.

PainMatrix,"&gt;For a short while, they were able to live off of turnips, a turtle they snagged from the water, and by drinking their own urine. One of the men -- the cabin boy -- refused to drink his urine and opted instead for seawater. This made him sick and he eventually slipped into a coma. While he was unconscious, his sailing buddies became increasingly hungry and eventually chose to draw straws to decide who should be sacrificed and consumed for the sake of the crew. Since the cabin boy was out cold, his straw had to be drawn for him and ""coincidentally"" ended up being the smallest.

PainMatrix,It's not that it's preferable it's just that it's really damn hard for people to lose weight on their own. I see some great success stories with bariatric surgery. 
PainMatrix,"Agreed. Not disagreeing with the bear, just wanted to let the commenter above me know that bariatric surgeries are actually good for society as a whole and quite effective. "
PainMatrix,"&gt; Gastric bypass surgery doesn't actually change the bad habits that led to the weight gain, so there's a lot of recidivism.

There is some recidivism I agree, but across all bariatric surgeries and on average, people achieve a weight loss of 45 to 65 pounds, which is maintained up to ten years (which is just as far the current research we have goes). Not only that but it pretty much cures diabetes, even before the weight loss occurs (at least in 80% of cases)! Also it is super cost-effective. It pays for itself in just about 4 years (due to decreased demand on the medical system treating comorbidities related to obesity). 

I'm all for people losing weight on their own, the problem is that by and large they don't. And in those that do, the vast majority regain it within 5 years. Here we have an incredibly effective and cost-effective surgery, why not use it. There are also some pretty new and potentially exciting new surgical and non-surgical options for this down the road.

PainMatrix,"I don't get my thinking about this at all, maybe I knew she was really into donuts? In retrospect the way it turned out was probably for the best. "
PainMatrix,"In high school I wanted to ask this girl out. So my plan was to get a box of donuts and attach them to helium balloons and send them up to her second story window with a card asking her out (I have no idea why this was the plan, this was 20 years ago). So, first thing is that it takes **a lot** of helium balloons to get a box of donuts to float up, I don't remember how many, but it had to be at least 30 or 40. So anyway; I get to her house and somehow had verified she would be in her room. I get the donuts up to near her window by holding a string to the box so they float up there. Just as I get them in place the string breaks and the balloons take off. I ring the doorbell frantically and yell for her to run downstairs so she can at least see my gesture. As she gets outside the box shifts 200 feet in the air and 2 dozen donuts come raining down just about 10 feet from us spraying jelly and powdered sugar in every direction...

I cleaned it up. We never had a date. "

The alpha female led the pack through the narrows between Wood Lake and Siskiwit Lake, then lagged behind to sniff an old moose track. Other wolves then assumed the lead position until they reached the first peninsula, where they stopped and waited for the alpha female to move to the front. She immediately set the direction of travel, led the way briefly, then fell back into a position in the middle of the pack. The same procedure was followed at the next point of land."

PainMatrix,"&gt;Hugh Laurie was so convincing as an American, the director himself didn’t realise he’s actually British. What makes this doubly hilarious is, the director of the show, Bryan Singer, was adamant that Dr. House be played by an American actor because he was convinced that British actors simply couldn’t muster up a convincing sounding American accent. Singer was so sure of this fact that he’d actually stopped considering any audition tapes from British actors entirely and instead tasked the casting people to redouble their efforts on hiring a “quintessentially American person“. "
PainMatrix,"Patrick Bateman takes his acting seriously:

&gt;During the shooting of the film, Christian Bale spoke in an American accent off set at all times. At the wrap party, when he began to speak in his own British accent, many of the crew thought he was speaking that way as an accent for another film - they had thought he was American throughout the entire shoot.

PainMatrix,"I do understand what atheism is. The narrow but specific definition of it the lack of belief in gods. The etymology is greek and has to do with rejecting the gods of the time. My problem here is the use of the word belief/disbelief which in both theism and atheism are not suited to the scientific requirements of testability and falsifiability. So to me the question becomes one of why even bother giving these a second thought, anymore then I would give a second thought to any other silly ideas that someone proposes. Why would I call myself an atheist and identify with that anymore than I would call myself an a-heavensgater, it gives the person whose system you're rejecting an awful lot of power. I'm agnostic, meaning that I don't give any credence to the concept of believability for the above mentioned reasons and I think that most atheists would classify themselves as such if they gave it the same thought.

Set up experiment where observe or otherwise measure moonbeams for pink unicorns. Using extrapolation and statistical analysis make determination that it is significantly unlikely that moonbeams contain pink unicorns. 

&gt;the non existence of anything is unprovable. 

bingo. So why even entertain or enter the discussion like atheism does. It's totally moot and pointless. Should I come up with a separate term for being a non-believer of moonbeam unicorns now?

&gt;Nobody is claiming there is no god, which would indeed be unverifiable. Rather, science posits that nothing is proven to exist unless there is sufficient proof, and without proof you can believe whatever you want. If you believe there is no god, what's wrong with that?

Nothing's wrong with any of it! Well, unless you kill, hurt, oppress, or judge people. "

PainMatrix,"I'm not familiar with the medical condition, but based on a [recent review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2780201/) here's what I found: 

&gt; Biofeedback has traditionally been used and has been successful in the treatment of constipation due to pelvic floor dysfunction. It has been used in slow transit constipation only when it is associated with pelvic floor dysfunction. There is no supporting evidence in a randomized, controlled fashion with its use in isolated slow transit constipation. Conflicting reports on the normalization of transit time after biofeedback exist. Emmanuel et al reported not only improvement in symptoms, but also an increase in transit, but the follow-up period was only 5 months. Long-term success of biofeedback also has conflicting data; some report success of only 20 to 35% after 12 months, whereas others report good success of 57 to 100% over 9 to 23 months"

Other medications — Numerous other medications have a sedating effect, but are not recommended for routine use in patients with insomnia. These include antidepressants, diphenhydramine, antipsychotics, and barbiturates.

Antidepressants — One antidepressant, doxepin, has been approved by the FDA at doses of 3 and 6 mg primarily for the treatment of insomnia. Other antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline, trazodone) are sedating because of central anticholinergic or antihistaminergic activity. Such antidepressants may be useful in the management of patients who have insomnia associated with depression, although they are not approved by the FDA for treatment of insomnia.

Sedating antidepressants have also been evaluated in patients with insomnia who are not depressed in a few studies:

●In a trial that randomly assigned 240 older adult patients with insomnia to receive low dose doxepin (1 or 3 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks, patients who received the 3 mg dose of doxepin had a reduction of wake time after sleep onset, increased total sleep time, increased sleep efficiency, and increased self-reported sleep quality when compared with placebo. Patients who received the 1 mg dose of doxepin had inconsistent improvement of some outcomes measures at several time points [87].

●Another trial randomly assigned 306 nondepressed patients with insomnia to receive trazodone, zolpidem, or placebo for two weeks [88]. After one week of therapy, trazodone improved subjective sleep latency, sleep duration, wake time after sleep onset, and number of awakenings, compared with placebo. However, after two weeks, the trazodone group did not differ significantly from the placebo group.

Despite their sleep-promoting effects, the routine use of sedating antidepressants other than low dose doxepin to treat insomnia in patients who are not depressed has not been recommended because the sedating effect tends to be short-lived and other side effects are common [1,89].

Diphenhydramine — Many over-the-counter sleep aids contain diphenhydramine (a sedating antihistamine) or a combination of diphenhydramine plus pain relievers. There is little evidence that diphenhydramine improves insomnia and it may cause sedation the next day (due to its long half-life). Additional side effects include decreased alertness, diminished cognitive function, delirium, dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, and increased intraocular pressure [1]. Routine use of diphenhydramine to treat insomnia is not recommended.

Antipsychotics — Antipsychotics have been used to treat insomnia. However, there are few trials that demonstrate effectiveness of these medications and all have potentially significant adverse effects. The routine use of antipsychotics to treat insomnia in patients without psychosis is not recommended [1].

Barbiturates — Barbiturates have similarly been used to treat insomnia. However, there is little evidence that these medications improve insomnia and all have potentially significant adverse effects. Routine use of barbiturates to treat insomnia is not recommended [1].

Over-the-counter — Herbal products, hormones, and alcoholic beverages have been used as sleep aids by patients with insomnia but there are sparse data upon which to evaluate their efficacy. These agents are not regulated by the FDA.

●Herbal products – A variety of herbal products are purported to be useful for insomnia. There is little evidence from randomized controlled trials about the efficacy of many herbals, however, and for those that have been well studied (eg, valerian), there is little evidence of benefit. A meta-analysis that included 14 randomized trials in over 1600 patients found no significant difference between any herbal medicine and placebo on any of 13 clinical efficacy measures of insomnia [90]. The majority of the trials (11 out of 14) studied valerian; chamomile, kava, and wuling were studied in one trial each. Unlike the other herbals studied, valerian was associated with a greater number of adverse events per person compared with placebo. Valerian may also produce hepatotoxic effects [1]. Contamination with undesirable substances poses a problem for many such natural remedies.

●Melatonin – Melatonin is a hormone that is normally secreted by the pineal gland. It does not appear to be beneficial as a treatment for insomnia in most patients with two exceptions: it may be useful in patients who have delayed sleep-wake phase syndrome (a circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorder) and in a subgroup of patients with low melatonin levels [1,91-96]. It appears to be safe when used short-term (three months or less) [93]. (See ""Classification of sleep disorders"", section on 'Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders'.)

●Alcohol – Alcohol is commonly self-prescribed as a sleep aid because it decreases the time required to fall asleep, at least in the short-term. However, alcohol can promote sleep disturbances later in the night and promotes upper airway instability and sleep apnea. These negative effects, coupled with the significant risk of dependence and interaction with other medications, preclude the use of alcohol to treat insomnia [97]."
PainMatrix,"(Part 2):

Melatonin agonists — Ramelteon is a melatonin agonist. In randomized trials, short-term use of ramelteon is associated with improvement in some sleep parameters in patients with insomnia, but the effect size is relatively small.

A 2014 meta-analysis that included 11 trials and over 5700 patients found that ramelteon was associated with significant improvement in subjective sleep latency (-4.6 minutes) and total sleep time (7.3 minutes) compared with placebo but no significant difference in other parameters, including subjective total sleep time, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset [68]. Although most studies examined short-term treatment and outcome in middle-aged adults [68], a small number of individual trials have demonstrated persistence of subjective benefit for at least six months, and improvement in older adults [69-73]. Subjective efficacy extended to one year in an open label trial [74].

Although ramelteon is approved in the United States and Japan, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded in 2008 that there was inadequate evidence that the drug was effective for insomnia [75]. It did not approve ramelteon for use. Tasimelteon is a second melatonin agonist that has been approved in the United States for treatment of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorder that occurs primarily in blind individuals [76,77].

Ramelteon binds to melatonin receptors expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus with much higher affinity than melatonin itself and has a half-life of 1.5 to 5 hours [78,79]. Ramelteon is metabolized by the liver and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic insufficiency. It is contraindicated in patients taking fluvoxamine, since fluvoxamine may decrease the metabolism of ramelteon [80]. Ramelteon is more effective in treating sleep onset insomnia compared with sleep maintenance insomnia.

Adverse effects associated with melatonin agonists are generally milder than those associated with benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines. The most common adverse effect is somnolence. (See 'Adverse effects of melatonin agonists' below.)

Orexin receptor antagonists — Orexin receptor antagonists are a novel class of drugs in development for the treatment of insomnia. Orexin A and orexin B are hypothalamic neuropeptides that play a key role in promoting wakefulness and regulating the sleep-wake cycle [81]. Suvorexant, an oral dual orexin receptor antagonist with a 12-hour half-life, was approved by the FDA in August 2014 [82].

The efficacy of suvorexant was demonstrated in a multicenter international trial of 781 patients with primary insomnia who were randomly assigned to receive nightly suvorexant or placebo in a 2:1 ratio for one year, followed by a two-month randomized discontinuation phase [83]. The dose of suvorexant used was 40 mg for patients &lt;65 years of age and 30 mg for patients ≥65 years. At one month, patients treated with suvorexant had improved subjective total sleep time (39 versus 16 minutes; difference 23 minutes, 95% CI 16-29) and subjective time to sleep onset (-18 versus -8 minutes, 95% CI -15 to -5) compared with placebo. Two-thirds of patients in each arm completed one year of treatment; improvements in subjective sleep persisted at one year. The most common adverse effect was somnolence, which was more common in patients treated with suvorexant than placebo (13 versus 3 percent). There was a trend toward rebound insomnia with discontinuation of suvorexant. A smaller trial showed similar results with short-term treatment and evidence of a dose-response gradient in both efficacy and side effects with doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg nightly [84].

In next-day driving performance testing, some men and women treated with 20 mg of suvorexant had impaired driving performance, including 5 out of 52 subjects who stopped testing early due to somnolence, and the FDA has approved suvorexant at a maximum dose of 20 mg per night [82,85]. Treatment should be initiated at the lowest dose (5 mg), so that the lowest effective dose can be determined. Suvorexant is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and there is potential for increased toxicity when used in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors (table 7). The recommended dose of suvorexant is 5 mg in patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, and it is not recommended for use in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Due to the potential for dependence and abuse, it is expected that suvorexant will be a schedule C-IV controlled substance.

The role for this drug in the treatment of insomnia remains to be determined, as suvorexant and other similar drugs in development have not yet been compared directly with other therapies for insomnia. It is notable that development of almorexant, another orexin receptor antagonist, was halted in 2011 for reasons that have not been made publicly available [86]."
PainMatrix,"Thanks /u/smeeee. 

The parasomniac effects of ambien are well known. Here's a review from uptodate on the various drugs used and their relative effectiveness:

Choice of an agent — Randomized trials directly comparing the effect of different medications on insomnia are rare. Indirect comparisons of benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines suggest that these classes of medication have a similar impact on sleep onset latency (ie, they decrease objective sleep onset latency by approximately 10 minutes and subjective sleep onset latency by 15 to 20 minutes) [49]. However, the benzodiazepines are more likely to prolong total sleep time, perhaps because they tend to have longer half-lives [49,50].

In one of the few trials that directly compared different medications, 382 patients with primary insomnia received each of six interventions in random order for two nights each, with a three- to seven-day wash-out period in between [51]. The agents included placebo, eszopiclone (1, 2, 2.5, and 3 mg), and zolpidem (10 mg). Compared with placebo, eszopiclone at doses of 2.5 and 3 mg decreased the median wake time after sleep onset, but zolpidem and eszopiclone at doses of 1 and 2 mg did not. The wake time after sleep onset refers to the amount of time that the patient is awake between sleep onset and the final morning arising time. There were no differences in any of the objective sleep outcomes when eszopiclone (2 and 3 mg) and zolpidem were compared directly.

Most clinicians select a sedative-hypnotic on the basis of the type of insomnia (ie, sleep onset or sleep maintenance) and the duration of effect:

●For patients with sleep onset insomnia, a short-acting medication is a reasonable choice for an initial trial of pharmacologic therapy. This may improve the insomnia with less residual somnolence the following morning. Examples of short-acting medications (duration of effect ≤8 hours) include zaleplon, zolpidem, triazolam, lorazepam, and ramelteon.

●For patients with sleep maintenance insomnia, a longer-acting medication is preferable for an initial trial of pharmacologic therapy. Examples of longer-acting medications include zolpidem extended release, eszopiclone, temazepam, estazolam, and low dose doxepin. However, these medications may increase the risk for hangover sedation and patients must be warned about this possibility.

●For patients with awakening in the middle of the night, both zaleplon and a specific sublingual tablet form of zolpidem have been developed for use during the night, with the constraint that there will be at least four hours of time in bed remaining after administration.

Other issues to be considered when prescribing a medication for insomnia include cost and adverse effects. The benzodiazepines and off-patent nonbenzodiazepines (specifically, zaleplon and zolpidem) tend to be less expensive than the other nonbenzodiazepines and ramelteon. The adverse effects are discussed below. (See 'Risks and side effects' below.)

Benzodiazepines — Benzodiazepines are a class of sleep promoting medications that bind to several gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subtypes [52]. They reduce the time to the onset of sleep, prolong stage 2 sleep, prolong total sleep time, and may slightly reduce the relative amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [53]. In addition, they decrease anxiety, impair memory, and have anticonvulsive properties.

Benzodiazepines commonly used for the treatment of insomnia include triazolam, estazolam, lorazepam, temazepam, flurazepam, and quazepam. A primary difference among these medications is their duration of action. Triazolam is short-acting; estazolam, lorazepam, and temazepam are intermediate-acting; flurazepam and quazepam are long-acting (table 5) [53]. Diazepam is also long-acting, but is generally not used to treat insomnia because it has a long duration of effect and can lead to the accumulation of active metabolites. The long-acting benzodiazepines should be avoided in older adults because there is increased risk for adverse effects in this patient population [54].

Meta-analyses of randomized, placebo-controlled trials indicate that benzodiazepines decrease sleep latency and the number of awakenings, while improving sleep duration and sleep quality [49,50,55,56]. Typical changes associated with these medications include decreases in the duration to sleep onset by approximately 10 minutes and increases in the total sleep time of 30 to 60 minutes [49,50].

The side effects of benzodiazepines are described below. (See 'Risks and side effects' below.)

Nonbenzodiazepines — Nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists have a structure that is different from the benzodiazepines and includes more targeted action at one GABA type A receptor. A consequence of their greater specificity is less anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity.

Nonbenzodiazepines appear to improve both subjective and objective sleep outcomes. Specifically, meta-analyses of randomized, placebo-controlled trials indicate that nonbenzodiazepines decrease sleep latency and the number of awakenings, while improving sleep duration and sleep quality [49,50,55-57]. Nonbenzodiazepines have increased adverse events compared with placebo.

Nonbenzodiazepines commonly used to treat insomnia include zaleplon, zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zolpidem extended release (table 6):

●Zaleplon has a very short half-life of about one hour. As a result, it is effective for patients who have difficulty falling asleep (ie, sleep onset insomnia), but may not be effective for patients who have difficulty maintaining sleep (ie, sleep maintenance insomnia) [58]. Due to the very short half-life, the potential for hangover sleepiness is minimal after normal sleep periods. Occasional side effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence [52]. Zaleplon is not indicated for long-term use.

●Zolpidem has a half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.4 hours. It is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep initiation [59]. The most common side effects are headache, dizziness, and somnolence, which can in turn lead to falls. Zolpidem is not approved for long-term use.

Zolpidem is also available in a dissolvable tablet and as an oral spray for patients who have difficulty swallowing a pill. A dissolvable tablet (1.75 to 3.5 mg) can be taken in the middle of the night for sleep maintenance insomnia, with the requirement that at least four hours be available to sleep after administration and at least five hours be available prior to driving. In January of 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety announcement recommending use of a lower dose in women than had been previously recommended [60]. This should also be considered in men. (See 'Dosing precautions' below.)

●Zolpidem extended release also has a half-life of about 1.5 to 2.4 hours, but is released over a longer duration. It was developed to improve both sleep onset insomnia and sleep maintenance insomnia while avoiding hangover effects, although it has never been directly compared with regular zolpidem [61]. Side effects of zolpidem extended release are relatively few, with the most common being headache, somnolence, and dizziness, which can in turn lead to falls [52]. In January of 2013, the FDA recommended use of a lower dose in women than had been previously recommended [60]. This lower dose should also be considered for men. In a follow-up safety announcement, the FDA added a warning that patients should not drive or engage in other activities that require complete mental alertness the day after taking zolpidem extended release because zolpidem levels can remain high enough the next day to impair these activities [62].

Sleep may be worse during the first night following discontinuation of this medicine. Zolpidem extended release is not limited to short-term use and there is little evidence for abuse or dependence in most patients. In theory, however, such medications could be habit forming with long-term use. (See 'Adverse effects of nonbenzodiazepines' below.)

●Eszopiclone has the longest half-life of the approved nonbenzodiazepines, approximately five to seven hours. This may extend to nine hours in older adult patients. Eszopiclone is effective for both sleep onset insomnia and sleep maintenance insomnia [63]. Patients taking eszopiclone may report an unpleasant metallic taste. Other reported side effects are shared with nonbenzodiazepines as a class (headache, dizziness, parasomnias, next-day impairment in some patients) [52,64]. (See 'Adverse effects of nonbenzodiazepines' below.)

Sleep may be worse on the first night after discontinuation of this medication. Eszopiclone is not limited to short-term use and there is little evidence for abuse or dependence in most patients. In theory, however, such medications could be habit forming with long-term use.

Most clinical trials evaluated short-term therapy (eg, seven days), although a few longer clinical trials have been performed. In one randomized trial, patients treated with eszopiclone for six months had improved quality of life, decreased work limitation, and improved sleep compared with placebo [65]. This persisted throughout the trial and the subsequent six month open label extension. In another randomized trial of 1018 patients with insomnia, zolpidem extended release taken for up to six months improved sleep onset, sleep maintenance, morning sleepiness, next-day concentration, and work performance compared with placebo [66,67].

Adverse effects associated with the nonbenzodiazepines are similar to those associated with benzodiazepines. This is discussed below. (See 'Risks and side effects' below.)

PainMatrix,Thank you. A post like this attracts all of the negative stories which is only one (hopefully small) part of it. I'm glad to hear you're getting good care. 
PainMatrix,"I have to stand up for the organization and veterans that I love. I am a VA mental health employee and I work my ass off for my veterans. I've been told by my bosses and the media that there are problems in the VA. I believe them; the problems, from what I see and hear are in the sunshine belt where the large influx of retirees inundated the system and they weren't prepared for them. Every single VA hospital is different. That's both a pro and a con, just like private hospitals. Of course the ones with bad raps (and I've worked with them), are going to have more vocal critics. That being said I hear from veterans every day that say how wonderful the VA is and how happy they are to be getting their care here. The VA is a major hub of innovation, research, and healthcare delivery. But of course, because it's the biggest healthcare system in the country its also a huge target. 

I love what I do and do it with pride. It hurts me to hear the job that I do disparaged. The reality in mental health is that no matter how hard you work or what you do, people are going to die. Of course I want us to be better at identifying and treating those people. In regards to this post though, I just hope no more people will leave it thinking the VA is a soulless monotonous entity. It's the opposite, it's an organization run by individuals. Some with ugly hearts but the vast majority of them caring and kind.  "
PainMatrix,"40 miles or if the veteran can't be seen within 30 days.

Whenever people hear about veterans and suicide there's an immediate reaction though. Many people don't understand that suicide is sometimes an unavoidable outcome despite anyone's best intentions or that it has nothing to do with veteran status.

Joe knew that come Monday, its back to grinding poverty. And Charlie was going to look back on this time as maybe the only happy point in his life. So Joe wanted to be a part of that. And not ruin it. With his depression."

PainMatrix,"[Here's a nice review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4578965/) even though it's 8 years old. Although exercise isn't what packs the punch when it comes to weight loss, it is absolutely crucial when it comes to weight maintenance. It's one of the biggest predictors of keeping it off. "
PainMatrix,"He's right, exercise is associated with more health benefits than any other health behavior you can change or pharmaceutical you can take. It just isn't where the punch is packed when it comes to weight loss, nutrition is. For example, 30 minutes of daily moderate physical activity is only associated with 5 lbs of weight loss over 6 months. "

PainMatrix,"&gt;The Incan high priests took the children to high mountaintops for sacrifice. As the journey was extremely long and arduous, especially so for the younger, coca leaves were fed to them to aid them in their breathing so as to allow them to reach the burial site alive.

They were then killed either by strangulation, a blow to the head, or by leaving them to lose consciousness [in the extreme cold and die of exposure.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sacrifice_in_pre-Columbian_cultures)

PainMatrix,"I hear what you're saying and I would agree if it was about the person themselves, but this is about the health of someone who has no say in the matter. Per the article, since the FDA made adding Folic acid to enriched grains in 1996:

&gt;Fortification eliminated about 10,000 defects in a decade, making it one of the top 10 public-health interventions of the 21st century’s first decade.

But they overlooked Corn masa at the time because it wasn't as popular. The health of the infant shouldn't suffer because the mother either lacks adequate medical care or education. "

It's because avoiding things that seem scary, threatening, or overwhelming feels good and is really reinforcing.

Our brains are programmed to release feel good chemicals when we dodge threats.

PainMatrix,"Dude, I hate to say this, but if you're having trouble with insomnia and working a variable shift schedule it's tough.

When you're sleeping during the day keep the room as dark as you possibly can. "
PainMatrix,"Two standard drinks of alcohol or less doesn't seem to have an impairing effect on sleep for males (1 maximum for females) but I would generally never advise alcohol as a solution (pun intended).

I don't know about masturbation, but I would infer that it helps with sleep because we know sex does. Hormones are released that promote relaxation. That can't be a bad thing."
PainMatrix,I'm glad you said this because there is so much individual variability and some people are incredibly resilient and not prone to sleep problems.
PainMatrix,One of the main things that I would say is that people tend to focus way too much on the quantity over the quality. Six hours of good quality sleep is worth way more than 8 to 10 hours of fragmented tossing and turning. Also the most important thing in regards to your circadian rhythm is a consistent wake up time down to within a few minutes every day including weekends.
PainMatrix,"There is some evidence that pot when used initially increases deep sleep but that effect fades over time. Pot use does suppress REM sleep at least modestly.

PainMatrix,"Hey OP, clinical health psychologist and behavioral sleep expert here. There have been quite a few discussions about this over in /r/behavioralmedicine and I've synthesized the current state of the evidence for improving insomnia below. Keep in mind that the more of the rules you can follow, the better you'll do. Specifically in regards to falling asleep quickly, rules 1 and 2 are the most relevant and the majority of people I work with can retrain their bodies to fall asleep quickly (15-20 minutes) within a couple of weeks. 


1. Only go to bed when sleepy. Bear in mind being sleepy is not the same thing as being tired. It is important to be aware of this difference. Sleepiness is signaled by behavioral signs such as dropping eyelids, involuntary head nodding and yawning. This rule helps prevent lying in bed engaging in negative sleep thoughts.

2. If after about 20 minutes you are unable to fall asleep or awaken and find it difficult to fall back asleep, leave the bed and go to another room and engage in a relaxing activity such as some light reading or using a relaxation technique until you do feel drowsy. Then return to bed and repeat as often as necessary until you do fall asleep. It is important to not watch the clock while doing this. It is your subjective estimate of time that is important. It is also important to not engage in stimulating activities during this time.

3. Use the bed only for sleep and sexual activity. Do not engage in sleep-incompatible activity in bed such as eating snacks, watching TV, etc. These activities obviously will result in arousal and make it difficult to fall asleep. Repeatedly engaging in these kinds of activities helps condition arousal to the bed environment when instead you want to condition a feeling of relaxation to being in bed.

4. Keep a regular morning rise time no matter how much sleep you got the night before. This will help regularize the circadian (24 hour) schedule and if you don't sleep well one night, the drive to sleep will be higher the following night - if you don't dissipate it with low quality, light morning sleep by staying in bed later than planned.

5. Avoid naps of more than 30 minutes. This prevents reducing sleep drive earlier in the day that can make it harder to fall asleep at night"

PainMatrix,Can't tell you much. I'm a PhD but know a few MD/PHDs and they're great. Sounds like you're in the U.K. and I can't tell you anything about their programs. 
PainMatrix,Definitely. I was trained in the scientific method (i.e. the Karl popper school of falsification). Doctors are not explicitly trained in the scientific method. They are taught what works and what doesn't work based on medical knowledge and experience. They are two very different but often overlapping worlds.

PainMatrix,In the [article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259) it's defined as 4 or more for a mass killing. 
PainMatrix,"The conclusions from the [actual open-access article:](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259)

tl;dr. There is a 1/4 to 1/3 increase in probability of mass killing or school shooting in the 2 weeks afterwards. States with more firearms and fewer regulations have increased probability of shootings. 

&gt;We find significant evidence that mass killings involving firearms are incented by similar events in the immediate past. On average, this temporary increase in probability lasts 13 days, and each incident incites at least 0.30 new incidents (p = 0.0015). We also find significant evidence of contagion in school shootings, for which an incident is contagious for an average of 13 days, and incites an average of at least 0.22 new incidents (p = 0.0001). All p-values are assessed based on a likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihood of a contagion model to that of a null model with no contagion. On average, mass killings involving firearms occur approximately every two weeks in the US, while school shootings occur on average monthly. We find that state prevalence of firearm ownership is significantly associated with the state incidence of mass killings with firearms, school shootings, and mass shootings."
PainMatrix,And ironically OP is posting a CNN report. Not sure why they didn't just post the PLOS [open access article.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259)

PainMatrix,"Even in a healthy person (no liver disease for example) calculating alcohol absorption and elimination rates is still difficult because it's dependent on a large number of variables including gender, body-size, drinking history, other medications, and age. Therefore, estimates of peak blood alcohol levels can vary anywhere from 30-90 minutes from last drink.

It can take up to 2 hours for one standard drink to leave your system. To calculate your BAC there are a number of online estimators, [here's one that includes both estimates of BAC and elimination rate.](http://celtickane.com/projects/blood-alcohol-content-bac-calculator/) This should only be used as a rough estimate and should not in any way be relied upon to make decisions about operating a motor vehicle.

PainMatrix,"PhD with expertise in insomnia here. /u/gangsecreto's edit is on the right track. Your ""sleep clock"" as they refer to it is actually a group of cells in a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We also refer to this as a circadian rhythm. Sleep is regulated by two processes, the ""sleep clock"" (your circadian rhythm) and a sleep drive (this builds throughout the day and is associated with a buildup of a neuromodulator called adenosine). If you ""oversleep"" your sleep drive may be low but your circadian rhythm is thrown off (it's regulated by consistency and especially waking up at the same time daily). In essence it's confused. This confusion causes some people to feel more rested and some people to feel more sleepy. One additional curve-ball in this is that if you ""oversleep"" you may sometimes be waking up in the middle of a sleep-cycle which will also cause you to feel sleepy for a period of time. 

Thanks /u/smeeee for alerting me to this thread.

PainMatrix,You wouldn't feel either if the person didn't mean anything to you and you were feeling secure. You would feel saddened if they were someone you cared about because you'd be disappointed and feeling a sense of loss about them not being who you thought they were. You would feel angry if you were feeling insecure about whatever the thing is they're talking about. 
PainMatrix,The medulla controls a lot of autonomic nervous system functions. I'm really curious how these functions interrelate with REM sleep.

PainMatrix,"I've done a similar stupid teenager version of this that didn't end as well. I was sneaking out in the middle of the night at age 16 with my parents car. Put the car in neutral and gave the car a good push from the front with the plan being to hop in the car while it's starting to roll and then use the slope of the driveway to get to a safe distance before starting it. Well, I misjudged the slope and the effect of the push and the car started to move away more quickly than I thought it would. I ran for it and as it reached the bottom of the driveway and started turning into the street (which was also downhill) I managed to hop in. I thought I was good, except there was one thing I didn't realize, which is that the cars brakes don't work when the car is turned off. At this point I'm probably going about 15 mph, backwards down the street, in the middle of the night. I finally yank on the emergency brake but it's too late and I slam the car into a rock and then a tree before it comes to a complete stop. The absolute worst part of this by far was not the thought that I could have seriously injured myself, but the thought of what I would tell my parents, and what they would do to me. 

Edit. apparently brakes do work when car is off but you have to press much harder. Thanks /u/difluoroethane!"
PainMatrix,"My wife and I decided to take the plunge on getting a cleaning person. The reason it has contributed so much to our happiness is that it buys back time. Our days are so busy since we both work and have little kids that having the extra hours means we can focus more on actually enjoying little moments. If you have the cash I highly recommend it. Before the cleaning person we had a roomba... that thing sucked.

Edit. Since there seems to be some confusion, I was making a pun, I'm a fan of the roomba and still use it regularly. "

"
PainMatrix,neuronal connections form between memories of things that you do and pain. That neuronal pathway is bidirectional meaning that when a memory or activity neuron is activated it also activates pain.
PainMatrix,"That's exactly what I was just referring to, these are neuronal branches and pathways."
PainMatrix,"I'll do you one better, the eli5 version:

Spread your hand out with your fingers extended. We're going to imagine that your hand is your somatosensory cortex (one of the primary pain processing centers) and the fingers are the various domains of your life. Your thumb is physical activity, each time you try to do something you hurt and the connection between your thumb and hand grows stronger. Your index finger is your social life, you try to do things with friends and be social but the more you try to be social the worse pain gets and the stronger the connection to your hand. The middle finger is sleep, you spend nights tossing and turning and trying to find a way to get comfortable, while the strength of the connection to your hand grows. Your ring finger is work and let's make your little finger the depression the anger and the anxiety that are continually being activated by your pain. 

So, the thing is that the brain doesn't just work in one direction, as the pulsing pain of your palm is radiating out to these various domains and mood states the connection is strengthening in both directions and associations are being formed. Merely the act of getting into bed, of being around friends, of trying to do a little walking or getting upset about something now activate pain as well, the fingers feed back into the hand creating a neural matrix of pain.

PainMatrix,On the other side of this fence though is the argument that either OP or his wife will not be able to just hide these feelings and thereby potentially make it an acrimonious environment to bring up kids.

That being said there seem to be a couple of different prevailing theoretical camps: In the first camp, experts believe that they are contractions within the muscle caused by muscles tensing repeatedly. The second camp disputes this citing lack of ability to see these contractions on a scan. This camp believes that the cause is neural and a product of irritated nerve endings."

The  defendant  in  that  action  was represented  by  the  preeminent  advocate  of  that  day,  and
raised the defense that the plaintiff was a foreign prince with no standing to sue in an American Court. This defense was overcome   by   overwhelming   evidence   to   the   contrary. Whether or not this would raise an estoppel in the present case we are unable to determine at this time.

PainMatrix,"You're describing what sounds like a REM sleep behavior disorder that also includes [hypnopompic hallucinations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnopompic) 12.5% of a [community sample](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maurice_Ohayon/publication/14313158_Hypnagogic_and_hypnopompic_hallucinations_pathological_phenomena/links/00b4952a5ed552df81000000.pdf) reports having experienced these (although the opposite, hallucinating while drifting to sleep is much more common. This is called a hypnogogic hallucination). The feeling that someone is in the room, which is what you described, is the most common type of hypnopompic hallucination. Limb and body jerking, punching, kicking, talking, shouting, swearing, leaping from bed, and [running into walls have all been described](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958868/) in the literature.

These types of hallucinations tend to be more common in people with insomnia, with drug and alcohol use disorders, and in people with depression and anxiety. The prevailing theory is that it's a disorder of the REM stage of sleep, but the underlying pathophysiology is not understood as far as I'm aware. It's not considered dangerous but adequate treatment of insomnia, drug &amp;amp; alcohol use, or underlying mood disorders can be beneficial."

&gt;As you can see in the video, researchers used water and propylene glycol to explore how fluid droplets will interact. The droplets' motion may seem chaotic at times, but the researchers explained much of the droplets' motion through the variations in surface tension between the droplets and their surrounding vapor.
&gt;When the droplets land on the glass surface, an encompassing vapor forms around the liquid droplets, creating a thin film that sticks to the glass. When one droplet encounters this film emanating from another droplet, it starts to pull toward its new neighbor due to an imbalance in surface tension. The area on the glass between the two droplets contains the thin vapor film, making it easier for the droplets to slide toward one another."

Lifetime risk of heart failure is about 20% so we're talking about a difference between 2 and 4% overall risk reduction.

A woman had in around 23 weeks pregnant having significant medical complications and about to give birth. We were told that she was in that position because she hadn't new able to afford prenatal care. While we were waiting for the doctors and nurses to come back to us our sons heart rate dropped precipitously and it was a good minute before any medical personnel came in while we panicked. They almost did an emergency c-section on my wife but were able to move our baby around and untangle the umbilical cord that was apparently the root of the problem. I think about that often, how one persons inability to afford adequate medical care compromised the health of two women and two babies. I'm not informed enough to have the answers but from what I've seen this is a larger and pervasive issue that needs to be addressed. Then again this was a few years ago, maybe things are starting to change.

PainMatrix,"The last US conviction for blasphemy [was in 1928:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_the_United_States)

&gt;The last U.S. conviction for blasphemy was of atheist activist Charles Lee Smith. In 1928 he rented a storefront in Little Rock, Arkansas, and gave out free atheist literature there. The sign in the window read: ""Evolution Is True. The Bible's a Lie. God's a Ghost."" For this he was charged with violating the city ordinance against blasphemy. Because he was an atheist and therefore couldn't swear the court's religious oath to tell the truth, he wasn't permitted to testify in his own defense. The judge then dismissed the original charge, replacing it with one of distributing obscene, slanderous, or scurrilous literature. Smith was convicted, fined $25, and served most of a twenty-six-day jail sentence. His high-profile fast while behind bars drew national media attention. Upon his release, he immediately resumed his atheist activities, was again charged with blasphemy, and this time the charge held. In his trial he was again denied the right to testify and was sentenced to ninety days in jail and a fine of $100. Released on $1,000 bail, Smith appealed the verdict. The case then dragged on for several years until it was finally dismissed."

Lance Corporal Buckley’s father still agonizes about whether the killing occurred because of the sexual abuse by an American ally. “As far as the young boys are concerned, the Marines are allowing it to happen and so they’re guilty by association,” Mr. Buckley said. “They don’t know our Marines are sick to their stomachs.”

The one American service member who was punished in the investigation that followed was Major Brezler, who had sent the email warning about Mr. Jan, his lawyers said. In one of Major Brezler’s hearings, Marine Corps lawyers warned that information about the police commander’s penchant for abusing boys might be classified. The Marine Corps has initiated proceedings to discharge Major Brezler.

Mr. Jan appears to have moved on, to a higher-ranking police command in the same province. In an interview, he denied keeping boys as sex slaves or having any relationship with the boy who killed the three Marines. “No, it’s all untrue,” Mr. Jan said. But people who know him say he still suffers from “a toothache problem,” a euphemism here for child sexual abuse."
PainMatrix,"KABUL, Afghanistan — In his last phone call home, Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. told his father what was troubling him: From his bunk in southern Afghanistan, he could hear Afghan police officers sexually abusing boys they had brought to the base.

“At night we can hear them screaming, but we’re not allowed to do anything about it,” the Marine’s father, Gregory Buckley Sr., recalled his son telling him before he was shot to death at the base in 2012. He urged his son to tell his superiors. “My son said that his officers told him to look the other way because it’s their culture.”

Rampant sexual abuse of children has long been a problem in Afghanistan, particularly among armed commanders who dominate much of the rural landscape and can bully the population. The practice is called bacha bazi, literally “boy play,” and American soldiers and Marines have been instructed not to intervene — in some cases, not even when their Afghan allies have abused boys on military bases, according to interviews and court records.

The policy has endured as American forces have recruited and organized Afghan militias to help hold territory against the Taliban. But soldiers and Marines have been increasingly troubled that instead of weeding out pedophiles, the American military was arming them in some cases and placing them as the commanders of villages — and doing little when they began abusing children.

“The reason we were here is because we heard the terrible things the Taliban were doing to people, how they were taking away human rights,” said Dan Quinn, a former Special Forces captain who beat up an American-backed militia commander for keeping a boy chained to his bed as a sex slave. “But we were putting people into power who would do things that were worse than the Taliban did — that was something village elders voiced to me.”

The policy of instructing soldiers to ignore child sexual abuse by their Afghan allies is coming under new scrutiny, particularly as it emerges that service members like Captain Quinn have faced discipline, even career ruin, for disobeying it.

After the beating, the Army relieved Captain Quinn of his command and pulled him from Afghanistan. He has since left the military.

Four years later, the Army is also trying to forcibly retire Sgt. First Class Charles Martland, a Special Forces member who joined Captain Quinn in beating up the commander.

“The Army contends that Martland and others should have looked the other way (a contention that I believe is nonsense),” Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who hopes to save Sergeant Martland’s career, wrote last week to the Pentagon’s inspector general.

In Sergeant Martland’s case, the Army said it could not comment because of the Privacy Act.

When asked about American military policy, the spokesman for the American command in Afghanistan, Col. Brian Tribus, wrote in an email: “Generally, allegations of child sexual abuse by Afghan military or police personnel would be a matter of domestic Afghan criminal law.” He added that “there would be no express requirement that U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan report it.” An exception, he said, is when rape is being used as a weapon of war.

The American policy of nonintervention is intended to maintain good relations with the Afghan police and militia units the United States has trained to fight the Taliban. It also reflects a reluctance to impose cultural values in a country where pederasty is rife, particularly among powerful men, for whom being surrounded by young teenagers can be a mark of social status.

Some soldiers believed that the policy made sense, even if they were personally distressed at the sexual predation they witnessed or heard about.

“The bigger picture was fighting the Taliban,” a former Marine lance corporal reflected. “It wasn’t to stop molestation.”

Still, the former lance corporal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid offending fellow Marines, recalled feeling sickened the day he entered a room on a base and saw three or four men lying on the floor with children between them. “I’m not a hundred percent sure what was happening under the sheet, but I have a pretty good idea of what was going on,” he said.

But the American policy of treating child sexual abuse as a cultural issue has often alienated the villages whose children are being preyed upon. The pitfalls of the policy emerged clearly as American Special Forces soldiers began to form Afghan Local Police militias to hold villages that American forces had retaken from the Taliban in 2010 and 2011.

By the summer of 2011, Captain Quinn and Sergeant Martland, both Green Berets on their second tour in northern Kunduz Province, began to receive dire complaints about the Afghan Local Police units they were training and supporting.

First, they were told, one of the militia commanders raped a 14- or 15-year-old girl whom he had spotted working in the fields. Captain Quinn informed the provincial police chief, who soon levied punishment. “He got one day in jail, and then she was forced to marry him,” Mr. Quinn said.

When he asked a superior officer what more he could do, he was told that he had done well to bring it up with local officials but that there was nothing else to be done. “We’re being praised for doing the right thing, and a guy just got away with raping a 14-year-old girl,” Mr. Quinn said.

Village elders grew more upset at the predatory behavior of American-backed commanders. After each case, Captain Quinn would gather the Afghan commanders and lecture them on human rights.

Soon another commander absconded with his men’s wages. Mr. Quinn said he later heard that the commander had spent the money on dancing boys. Another commander murdered his 12-year-old daughter in a so-called honor killing for having kissed a boy. “There were no repercussions,” Mr. Quinn recalled.

In September 2011, an Afghan woman, visibly bruised, showed up at an American base with her son, who was limping. One of the Afghan police commanders in the area, Abdul Rahman, had abducted the boy and forced him to become a sex slave, chained to his bed, the woman explained. When she sought her son’s return, she herself was beaten. Her son had eventually been released, but she was afraid it would happen again, she told the Americans on the base.

She explained that because “her son was such a good-looking kid, he was a status symbol” coveted by local commanders, recalled Mr. Quinn, who did not speak to the woman directly but was told about her visit when he returned to the base from a mission later that day.

So Captain Quinn summoned Abdul Rahman and confronted him about what he had done. The police commander acknowledged that it was true, but brushed it off. When the American officer began to lecture about “how you are held to a higher standard if you are working with U.S. forces, and people expect more of you,” the commander began to laugh.

“I picked him up and threw him onto the ground,” Mr. Quinn said. Sergeant Martland joined in, he said. “I did this to make sure the message was understood that if he went back to the boy, that it was not going to be tolerated,” Mr. Quinn recalled.

There is disagreement over the extent of the commander’s injuries. Mr. Quinn said they were not serious, which was corroborated by an Afghan official who saw the commander afterward.

(The commander, Abdul Rahman, was killed two years ago in a Taliban ambush. His brother said in an interview that his brother had never raped the boy, but was the victim of a false accusation engineered by his enemies.)

Sergeant Martland, who received a Bronze Star for valor for his actions during a Taliban ambush, wrote in a letter to the Army this year that he and Mr. Quinn “felt that morally we could no longer stand by and allow our A.L.P. to commit atrocities,” referring to the Afghan Local Police.

The father of Lance Corporal Buckley believes the policy of looking away from sexual abuse was a factor in his son’s death, and he has filed a lawsuit to press the Marine Corps for more information about it.

Lance Corporal Buckley and two other Marines were killed in 2012 by one of a large entourage of boys living at their base with an Afghan police commander named Sarwar Jan.

Mr. Jan had long had a bad reputation; in 2010, two Marine officers managed to persuade the Afghan authorities to arrest him following a litany of abuses, including corruption, support for the Taliban and child abduction. But just two years later, the police commander was back with a different unit, working at Lance Corporal Buckley’s post, Forward Operating Base Delhi, in Helmand Province.

Lance Corporal Buckley had noticed that a large entourage of “tea boys” — domestic servants who are sometimes pressed into sexual slavery — had arrived with Mr. Jan and moved into the same barracks, one floor below the Marines. He told his father about it during his final call home.

Word of Mr. Jan’s new position also reached the Marine officers who had gotten him arrested in 2010. One of them, Maj. Jason Brezler, dashed out an email to Marine officers at F.O.B. Delhi, warning them about Mr. Jan and attaching a dossier about him.

The warning was never heeded. About two weeks later, one of the older boys with Mr. Jan — around 17 years old — grabbed a rifle and killed Lance Corporal Buckley and the other Marines.

PainMatrix,[This article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945234/) talks about the manifestation of Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy (CTE) in football players and boxers. CTE was actually called dementia pugilistica initially because it was first seen in boxers.
PainMatrix,"They're saying ""Brain disease"" for the general public. It's a progressive degenerative disease known as Chronic Traumatic Encphelapothy (CTE) and the clinical progression is as follows:

The first stage is characterized by affective disturbances and psychotic symptoms. Social instability, erratic behavior, memory loss, and initial symptoms of Parkinson disease appear during the second stage. The third stage consists of general cognitive dysfunction progressing to dementia and is often accompanied by full-blown Parkinsonism, as well as speech and gait abnormalities.

PainMatrix,"Exactly, some of the responsibility for the loss of his opioids has to fall on the veteran who knowingly violated the contract he himself agreed to. I think the burning question is should this policy be there in the first place? Is the interaction between these two drugs is really as significant as it's made out to be? And yet another different but related issue is that marijuana continues to be illegal on the federal level, which from my understanding to some degree ties the hands of VA doctors."
PainMatrix,"&gt;presumably after having heard a voice ordering food.

PainMatrix,"Gifs use what is called ""lossless"" compression meaning that every single frame is a full picture. Videos use what is called ""lossy"" compression which means that redundant information is eliminated and/or more compromises can be made between file size and image quality. However gifs have been around a really long time so although they take up more information they are supported by all browsers and from what I understand are easier to host on a web-page. "

President Berdymukhamedov promotes a personality cult in which he, his relatives, and associates enjoy unlimited power and total control over all aspects of public life

&gt;Turkmenistan had the 3rd worst press freedom conditions in the world (178/180 countries), just before North Korea and Eritrea.

I often tell my patients to publicly announce their goals. In my clinical experience there are few better motivators then telling your wife/husband/friend your intentions to quit smoking/lose weight/ exercise more. The thing about being a therapist though is that you also set the goal for the individual patient. There are some patients where I know that the public announcement wouldn't work. My guess is that there are rather large environmental x individual factors involved. "

PainMatrix,"You're asking some big questions! Most graduate programs (to my knowledge) require that you have a moderate-strong undergraduate background in that field.

I can't really think of a specific reading, I would instead encourage you to spend some time thinking about what you want your career to look like: do you want to work with people? Do you want to teach? Are you interested in research and writing (seeing as you have a background in literature). 

I would e-mail that professor who gave the talk and let them know you have an interest in PTSD. I think it's okay to say that you have a personal interest in it, but emphasize that you are interested in this as a potential career path, that you'd like to gain some experience, and that you're willing to help out however you can.

PainMatrix,"Since the Earth is filling the frame, let’s estimate he starts at about 8,000 miles away (close to the diameter of the Earth). He covered that distance in about 9.2 seconds meaning he’s traveling at 3,200,000 mph or 889 miles per second.

PainMatrix,"I think you described one of the core symptoms of borderline personality disorder really well by noting the intensity. That's the problem for many people with that diagnosis is that there is no middle of the road feeling, it's extremes, and it can often get them into trouble.

It teaches skills to become more adept at recognizing and managing those highs and lows. "

- the term ""ethnological exposition"" is more highfalutin and therefore obfuscates the meaning a bit."

PainMatrix,"I believe the origin of this list is from /r/suicidewatch. It hasn't been updated in quite a while, so I did some myself, and I was hoping some of the good people in this sub could also pitch in with resources available where they live.

There is often much pain that leads up to making the decision to end your life. I've heard a number of stories both through the media and through my patients who have made attempts that they felt they were out of options or they had nobody who could understand. Almost uniformly, all of those who attempted immediately felt relief upon discovering that their attempt had failed. 

Things **can** get better and there is hope no matter how out of options you may believe yourself to be. I obviously can't speak for all of the resources above, but the ones in the US have literally been life-lines for many of my patients and in a number of cases have saved their lives. 

If you suspect someone you know may be suicidal, speak up. It is a myth that talking to someone about suicide is going to drive them to it. If you yourself are feeling suicidal, or alone, or desperate, I implore you to utilize some of these resources. "

PainMatrix,"A bunch of studies have suggested long term (up to 1 year) likely benefits of low carb diets on metabolic factors ([eg](http://m.ajcn.nutrition.org/content/90/1/23.long)), but I'd be really curious at studies examining cognitive functioning as the brain has less ""fuel.""

Kindergarten drop off was a nightmare for like 3 months for me. This stuff isn't easy. "
PainMatrix,"[Factcheck](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/leftover-campaign-funds/) does a good job of explaining it. 

&gt;As Bob Biersack from the Federal Election Commission points out, most candidates don’t have much left over to begin with. Campaigning is expensive, and “leftover” money gets used for bills and debts first, including expenses incurred while winding down an abandoned campaign or a lost political office.

&gt;Candidates do sometimes end up with surplus funds, though, particularly if they’re incumbent members of Congress who decide not to run for another term. State and local governments have their own rules, but those running for federal office — including presidential candidates — must abide by strict FEC guidelines when it comes to their extra campaign money. They can donate an unlimited amount to a charity or political party. They can also, within limits, make contributions directly to other candidates. A campaign committee can give up to $2000 per election to each candidate. If the committee is converted into a political action committee, the limit jumps to $5000 – but to be established as a PAC, the committee would have to be in existence for six months, receive contributions from 50 donors, and make contributions to five recipients.
What candidates can’t do with leftover money is use it for personal expenses. Retiring federal lawmakers used to be able to pocket extra cash and use it for cars, vacations, clothes, pet grooming, whatever — but that changed in 1989 with the passage of the Ethics Reform Act."

As many people are aware [the mean number of hours is 7](http://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/2003SleepPollExecSumm.pdf), but you're statistically on the high end of things. Only between 5-10% of people sleep 9 hours or more. Additionally, there really is such a thing as early-risers and night-owls and you're obviously of the latter persuasion. The one thing that you bring up that may be a fly in the ointment (and also judging by your username) is alcohol: more than 2 drinks in males is associated with suppression of REM sleep, meaning that most people require more sleep in order to make up for that loss. Please let me know if you have any other questions."

A couple of years went by and he asked to try it again and I warily accepted. He loved it, he ran after the ball, made shots, and overall had a blast. It was like watching a completely different kid. It's been a full year and he still loves the sport and I get to coach so it's a fun bonding experience.

PainMatrix,"[Other examples](http://www.livescience.com/50051-albert-einstein-civil-rights.html) of Einstein speaking out/fighting against racism: 

&gt; 1. Shortly before moving to America, Einstein backed a campaign to defend the Scottsboro Boys, nine Alabama teenagers who were falsely accused of rape in 1931.

&gt;2. When Princeton's Nassau Inn refused to rent a room to contralto opera star Marian Anderson because of her skin color, Einstein invited the singer home as his guest. Their friendship lasted from 1937 until his death in 1955, and Anderson stayed with the Einsteins whenever she visited Princeton.

&gt;3. In 1946, Einstein gave a rare speech at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black university, where he also accepted an honorary degree. The appearance was significant because Einstein made a habit of turning down all requests to speak at universities. During his speech, he called racism ""a disease of white people.""

&gt;4. Einstein was a friend and supporter of African-American actor and singer Paul Robeson, who was blacklisted because of his civil rights work. The pair worked together in 1946 on an anti-lynching petition campaign. In 1952, when Robeson's career had bottomed out because of the blacklisting, Einstein invited Robeson to Princeton as a rebuke to the performer's public castigation.

&gt;5. For decades, Einstein offered public encouragement to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and its founder, W. E. B. Du Bois. And in 1951, when the federal government indicted the 83-year-old Du Bois as a ""foreign agent,"" Einstein offered to appear as a character witness during the trial. The potential publicity convinced the judge to drop the case. 

&gt;6. In January 1946, Einstein published the essay, ""The Negro Question.""

Edit. Some people are taking umbrage with his calling racism ""a disease of white people."" Here is the full quote to provide some additional context:

&gt;My trip to this institution was in behalf of a worthwhile cause. There is a separation of colored people from white people in the United States. That separation is not a disease of colored people. It is a disease of white people. I do not intend to be quiet about it."

PainMatrix,"Hi /u/BluebirdHaiku, 

I'm glad you posted this here, your post is not only relevant to this sub, but I'm sure that many other women who are or have been pregnant can identify with many of the fears and concerns that you've mentioned. In fact, [more than 1 in 8 women](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp1102730) experiences depression during pregnancy and it's even higher [(1 in 4)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524160) among women with seizure disorders. So, now you know that it's very common which probably doesn't help, but the good news is that it's also highly treatable. 

For women with moderate depression, [the recommendation](http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG045) is for cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal therapy. These are types of therapy with a large evidence-base showing that they are efficacious (in other words, they work!). In cases of severe depression, an antidepressant may be considered, but this should be done in conjunction with your pcp, ob/gyn, or other medical professional. 

I certainly get the sense from your post that you're feeling overwhelmed and like you're failing. You've mentioned yourself twice in your post that you know the way you're feeling is not rational, but yet you can't help but buy into it. We call this ""emotional reasoning,"" and it's a very common thought pattern in depression. A good clinician will work with you on taking these irrational thoughts out of your head (where they are just bouncing around and compounding one another) and disputing them and challenging them. They will work with you on setting goals and building your efficacy so that you can begin to improve your mood and move forward for both you and your baby. In regards to your specific questions:

&gt;1) How can I motivate myself to even take care of myself so I can get better?

You already took a big step by setting up an appointment with a counselor. I know that it's several weeks off, but it will be here soon. In the meantime I would recommend setting small attainable goals for yourself daily. Use a planner and prioritize your tasks. Taking care of yourself should be at the top of the list, the dishes cleaning and laundry should not. Once you begin to attain your smaller goals you can begin to build on them!

&gt;2) Are there any antidepressants that are safe to take during pregnancy and that don't lower seizure threshold?

A medical professional may be able to answer this question specifically, but I can tell you that women with epilepsy [are prescribed antidepressants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524160), although at rates lower than women without epilepsy. 

&gt;3) How badly is my depression during pregnancy going to screw over my baby before she even has a chance?

Yes, prenatal depression does appear to have some impact on the child, but there doesn't seem to be a good understanding of the mechanisms, and there is huge individual variability. My educated guess is that a warm, loving, and stable postnatal environment like what you're going to bring your girl into will mitigate many of the negative effects. The other piece of good news here is that you're doing something about it and it may therefore not even be relevant at all!

&gt;4) If I talk to my doctor about this, are they going to think I am a danger to my baby or my 4-year-old and take them away? They are basically my reason for living right now, so that would destroy me. To be clear, there is definitely no abuse or neglect going on, and my husband helps a TON with the parenting. I'm probably just irrationally afraid because I feel like such an unfit parent right now.

This should never be the case! The only time that a mandated reporter would be concerned about taking your baby away is if there was concern about abuse or neglect. You are dealing with something very common (as I mentioned up top) and your doctor is going to want to help you get through it in any way they can. 

&gt;5) If I somehow manage to get this all sorted out through counseling before the baby is born, am I still pretty much condemned to postpartum depression since I have been depressed during the pregnancy? 

Yes, the literature suggests there is a link between prenatal and postpartum depression but it is by no means set in stone and you are actively working to change that for yourself. Make sure you utilize your support systems, take good care of yourself, and follow-up with counseling or counseling + medication. Don't give up on it or abandon it. 

You sound like you're already a great mom and you can do this. Good luck, /u/bluebirdhaiku"

PainMatrix,"It's realistic conflict theory as illustrated by the [Robbers Cave experiment](http://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html). Individuals bond together to form groups with shared values, hierarchies, etc. When two groups compete for resources or in other ways conflict will occur.

Dissolving inter-group conflict can be accomplished by either bringing the groups together and allowing them to interact in a neutral way while getting to know one another as individuals. Alternately, it can be accomplished if a common rival forces the groups to band together. "

PainMatrix,"Can confirm it's tough. My wife and I both work professional jobs that can be draining.

PainMatrix,I'm going to err on the side of this being more due to heat coupled with the psychological concern that you had about passive smoking.

PainMatrix,"First of all, thanks for responding. Second, I'm not so sure I agree. The definition: ""search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the Internet,"" seems to fit.

PainMatrix,"&gt; Indoctrination of children is evil.

I think your brush-strokes may be a bit broad here. The very act of raising children is indoctrination through both the actions and inactions of a parent.

I think it's a bit unfair and far-reaching to refer to it as ""taking advantage of"" or ""evil."" "

All women seeking an abortion at the facility are asked to complete a precounsel-
ing needs assessment form along with other intake forms at the time they present for care. "

Essentially, 87% of the women were highly confident of the decision going in. Interestingly, they found that being younger, black, and less educated lowered the degree of confidence. Not surprisingly, having a supportive partner or parent increased confidence. "

PainMatrix,Looks like it's about to set [sail](http://youtu.be/7yawBHSKHzM)
PainMatrix,"There are a couple of comments I have. The first is that caffeine intoxication can be very aversive but is not necessarily acutely dangerous. This is typically associated with consumption greatly in excess of 250mg (approx. 5-6 cups of tea depending on the type/brand) and paired with a number of symptoms related to stimulant overuse. My second comment is that high consumption of caffeine (e.g. [tea](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/10/2409.full) or [coffee](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/10/2409.full) is typically not recommended due to the association with headaches, nausea, anxiety, etc. In addition, the addictive nature of caffeine can lead to increasing amounts and withdrawal symptoms with discontinuation. 

I think we have a nutritionist on this sub, but my understanding of the literature is that as long as you drink caffeine in moderation it's not currently associated with any negative health consequences. "

PainMatrix,"&gt;Tailoring would just make the problem worse

But not being flexible enough would be an underfitting issue. 

You added some stuff to your previous comment I see. I think you and I are looking at the problem of behavior change the same way but from different sides. I do individual therapy with people where it is absolutely paramount that we extricate their individualized thoughts and behaviors to assist them in making sense of their past behaviors and predicting/changing their future ones. As far as I can tell, you are interested in a macro-level model of predicting behavior change. I think that's great and I applaud you for it. "
PainMatrix,"Which of course is why this needs to be individually tailored, and any model needs to be sufficiently flexible. "
PainMatrix,"Although I appreciate some of the sentiments in this brochure, overall it is a bit reductionist and I don't particularly like being sold something. 

I think perhaps a more useful way to look at motivation and behavior change is to think about how people are motivated to do something when the perceived pros outweigh the perceived cons. And that this is a process that is often in flux and loaded with ambivalence. One useful model for thinking about how to apply this waxing and waning motivation to yourself is through the [transtheoretical model](http://www.psychotherapy.com.au/fileadmin/site_files/events/pdfs/APPLYING_THE_STAGES_OF_CHANGE_JOHN_NORCROSS.pdf) also sometimes referred to as the *Stages of Change* model (the transtheoretical model also has some limitations, but I won't get into that here). 

Essentially the idea is to first understand why you should even bother changing by gathering information about the consequences and benefits and breaking apart the ambivalence. As change happens, it should be continually reinforced. 

A related concept is the idea of motivational interviewing which is a therapeutic process to help guide patients to change. /u/halfascientist did a nice job gathering some resources that talk about this technique in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/38dmfv/motivational_interviewing_in_the/)"

PainMatrix,"I'm sure /u/smeeee would agree with me that the first step would be to meet with your pcp and get a panel done.

Insomnia is a very common co-occurrence with menopausal symptoms. Estrogen directly seems to have a sleep effect and as it decreases this can disrupt sleep. This and the onset of hot flashes are two of the primary reasons for insomnia. [In a subset of women](http://www.aasmnet.org/JCSM/Articles/010312.pdf) menopause also coincides with an increase in pain and arthritic symptoms which also disrupts sleep for obvious reasons. Depending on what you discuss with your pcp and what turns out to be the primary issue, they may discuss a variety of things including hormone replacement therapies, exercise, and in some cases even antidepressants. 

Regardless of the origin of your sleep issue, stimulus control therapy is an efficacious therapy for insomnia that is recommended to all patients whether their sleep issues are of a primary or secondary nature.

At the heart of this is to find ways to safely reduce and limit prescription opioids:

&gt;coordinates pain management to include patient and provider education, testing and tapering programs, and alternative therapies like acupuncture and behavior therapy.

This program has its dissenters too. There is a small but vocal minority that believes that it's ""too late"" for the long term chronic opioid users, that their neurobiology has changed irrevocably and that contracts and harm reduction are the way to go. This group of dissenters believes the focus should be on prevention instead.

I don't agree with that. In my own experience I found it possible for many patients to reduce or even eliminate opioids that they had been on for years. "
PainMatrix,"There may be such a thing as non-celiac gluten sensitivity as well. There was a small study (although well-designed), that was just published earlier this year demonstrating [an increase in GI symptoms](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25701700) in subjects given gluten vs. placebo. Replications need to be done, but it may be suggestive.

In terms of getting research experience as an undergrad first figure out what you're interested in and then try to generally match up those interests with the psychology professors at your school. E-mail/call/drop in during office hours on them and let them know you're interested in research and would like to know what's available.

"
PainMatrix,"Clinical Psychologist

- You're not going to lay on a couch and tell me about your childhood and dreams. Modern psychotherapy **can be** short-term and action-focused. My average number of sessions is 6-8.

- You're not alone. Lifetime prevalence rates for meeting criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis is around 50%. This means that half of us at some point are going to be dealing with an issue that is causing a problem in our lives, whether it's alcohol and drug-use, depression, anxiety, etc.

- There IS hope and treatment that can greatly improve your functioning. Yes, many psychiatric diagnoses are recurring, but with adequate and appropriate treatment people are able to feel better, improve their functioning, and even return to baseline.

- On a more personal level, I am completely attuned with and care about you during our session. However, I don't think much about you if at all when I go home. If I wasn't able to compartmentalize these things I wouldn't be as effective a therapist. 

These are just some initial thoughts off the top of my head. /r/behavioralmedicine is a great resource for asking questions about psychology and health. "

PainMatrix,"&gt;I wasn't aware of that rule. There is a set limit on how negative your ""karma score"" can become before you get your account banned from the site?

No, you can't get banned for a negative karma score, reddit just no longer will show a negative karma score below -100, see case in point the troll above. It used to be open-ended. The record was around -100,000 before the user got banned, I forgot the name but I'm sure someone will help me."
PainMatrix,"I think it comes down to your intent. Sounds like you're looking to be sardonic or a little outrageous because you're having a laugh. The intent of a troll is to set out to say things to specifically garner downvotes. On reddit, they need to do this carefully and artfully in order to not be banned. They get off on both the game of being able to navigate this as well seeing how many downvotes they can get. One of the best things that reddit did was to limit the number of total karma downvotes that people can get. I think this hugely limited the number of trolls. "

PainMatrix,"If they have not been treated I would be a little leery of the diagnosis. Bipolar disorder is not something that should be self-diagnosed. 

However, assuming that they do have at least some mental health symptoms that are cause for concern I would ask them the following: ""Would you go to a doctor if you had cancer?"" I'm not being flippant here, mental health conditions are medical (they're neurobiological). However, due to the complexity of the brain we don't have perfect assessment or treatment protocols. So, I think information is key here, here is just one article that talks about the [medical nature of bipolar disorder](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737175.8.1.93), you can find many others yourself. 

Having the right information is the first step. The second thing you can do is to listen empathically to your friend.

PainMatrix,"Harry Potter and the Hobbit

With Lord Voldemort now long gone the accumulated traumas that Harry has endured have caught up with him and he finds himself increasingly unable to tolerate the doldrums of the quiet familial existence he and Ginny had planned. Insidiously the demons from his past dig their claws in deeper and deeper. Not able to endure any longer, Ginny leaves him and Harry adopts the lifestyle of the vagabond, moving fluidly and transiently between the worlds of magic, muggle, and middle-earth. He works small jobs when they are available before moving on, keeping no connections as he goes. One day while wandering through Middle Earth he encounters a shire and a fellow wizard, Gandalf. Sparking up conversation and kinship and feeling that he has nothing to lose, Harry is convinced by Gandalf to join him on an adventure to assist a band of dwarves reclaiming their treasure. They are accompanied by a diminutive and helpless muggle-oid type creature named Bilbo. 

On their journey they come upon both trolls and goblins. Harry is easily able to defeat the trolls with a series of offensive spells as Gandalf whimsically looks on. The goblins are not so easily dispelled but are given empty promises of vast riches to satisfy their greedy desires. In the midst of these encounters, Harry notices that the muggle-oid has stolen off. Harry, however, is numbly hungry for more battle and convinces the party that they must move on. 

They make their way to the Lonely Mountain and Harry, using a revealing charm finds a secret passageway to make their way inside. They soon come upon the massive dormant dragon, and Harry remembering Ron’s brother Charlie, steels himself for the inevitable conflict. Taking advantage of the dragons slumber Harry lifts his wand and directs the Avada Kedavra directly at the dragons head… Smaug opens his eyes and roars, sending vast flames in the direction of the band of dwarves and wizards. Harry, reacting quickly, hops on his broom, and feeling the searing heat on his back flies upwards towards the roof of the grand cavern and down a side-tunnel. Looking backward he only obliquely registers that all of his company has been incinerated by dragon-fire. 

Harry lands a little way down the tunnel, his breath swift and shallow, wondering what his next course of action should be. Hearing a clink he turns around to see the muggle-oid, Bilbo, chasing a ring. “How did you make your way here,” Harry demands. “I found this ring and it makes me invisible. I followed you all through the passageway and snuck up to the dragon….he has a weakness.” Harry, fondly remembering his own invisibility cloak, finds a sliver of a smile creeping in to his face. “Show me...”"

PainMatrix,"Hey K-dot I thank you for adding to the discussion and I certainly don't want to delete your post, but I want to make it unequivocally clear that long-term opiate therapy has not been shown to be efficacious. From the very article you posted:

&gt;Manchikanti and colleagues recently conducted a 
rigorous review of the literature regarding the effectiveness 
of opioids for the management of chronic noncancer pain. 
They concluded that short-term opioid therapy (defined as 
treatment for 3 months or less) may result in a moderate 
degree of pain relief, but the evidence to support this conclusion is weak. Likewise, there is a paucity of high-quality 
evidence to support the efficacy of long-term opioid therapy 
(therapy lasting longer than 3 months), and studies assessing the impact of long-term opioid therapy on quality of life 
show equivocal results"
PainMatrix,"&gt; I can reduce my opioid use but not eliminate it?

Actually many people are able to eliminate it! I'm not sure if you've read through all of the information I originally posted, but please do and then I would encourage you to look into your options based on your insurance. "
PainMatrix,"Ugh, bought a home just before the bubble burst in 2007. Got rid of it in 2012 and lost about 20% of what we originally bought it for (despite massive upgrades). That still stings. "
PainMatrix,That practice ended in the 80's though. Now of course the flip side of that coin is the concern that anesthesia is harming neural development in infants. You just can't win when it comes to cutting open babies. 
PainMatrix,"Yes, to go back to my original post integrated pain clinics are wonderful and effective resources to help treat all of the aspects of actual real chronic pain and they've been shown to have good long-term outcomes. They have an especially good record for lower back-pain because it's the most common pain and therefore the most widely studied. Many patients that go through programs like this or similar to this are able to reduce opioid medications. 

I don't know how else to say it to you /u/netbich, this stuff really actually works for real actual chronic pain that can be seen via imaging. "
PainMatrix,"So, all pain is **real** pain but what you have to remember is that pain is the emotional and sensory experience created by the manner in which your brain processes the signal from your lower-back. This signal processing and conversion is moderated by a large number of physiological and neurobiological factors. In essence, what this means is that **real** pain needs to be treated as much biologically as it does psychologically and neurobiologically (when possible). Hence the ""biopsychosocial model."" This is why treating a persons depression for example, can have a **real** impact on their pain."

PainMatrix,"Hey /u/netbich, I wonder what you mean by **really** painful. Do you mean like on a continuum of pain this pain is on the high end, or do you mean that my doctors don't believe me but the pain is real? Either way, (and depending on the condition and severity), chronic pain really needs to be tackled at the least in a multidisciplinary fashion and at best in an interdisciplinary setting. This [open access article](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0035514.pdf) talks about what this should look like and why long-term use of opioids are typically not an appropriate recommendation. It also discusses the effectiveness of interdisciplinary clinics on page 123 of the article [spoiler alert](/sp ""They are effective!"")

That being said there is no such thing as ""one size fits all,"" but all patients should be at least evaluated for appropriateness for some combination of the following:

- medical interventions which may include surgery, medications, injections, neurostimulators, etc.

- physical/occupational therapy interventions to improve physical functioning

- relaxation and mental health interventions

The American Chronic Pain Association has a nice [up-to-date report](http://www.theacpa.org/uploads/documents/ACPA_Resource_Guide_2015_Final%20edited%20%283%29.pdf) where many treatment approaches are listed. 

The CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) website also has a description of interdisciplinary pain programs and a portal to access providers [here](http://carf.org/Programs/ProgramDescriptions/MED-Interdisciplinary-Pain-Outpatient/) that may be useful.

There is no magic bullet as you well know /u/netbich, but that doesn't mean that quality of life and functioning can't be improved and as you can see there are a plethora of resources and options that are available. "
PainMatrix,"That's the click-bait title. From what you linked it says that the survey did not mention Bush but just the federal government and that:

PainMatrix,"/u/bennybyrnes, I second /u/buffalo_buffallo's post but also want to expand on this that Habit Reversal Therapy is a multi-component therapy that has been shown to be effective [above and beyond](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735811000754) just trichotillomania to treating a wide variety of what we would call ""habit disorders.""

I think the site is behind a paywall so here are the relevant sections of what the treatment involves (There are 5 main components): 

&gt;Awareness training is based on the premise that increased awareness of behavior facilitates self-control ( Piacentini &amp; Chang, 2005). A client is taught to discriminate each occurrence of the habit, including the environmental antecedents that precede its manifestation. Awareness training components include: (a) response description: identification of occurrences surrounding performance of the target behavior, (b) response detection: self-observation and diary monitoring of the topography, frequency and severity of target movements, (c) early warning: focusing on the sensations preceding behavior onset, and (d) situation awareness: acknowledgement of high-risk situations for the target behavior.

&gt;Relaxation training is based on the premise that increases in stress lead to increases in habit behaviors ( Piacentini &amp; Chang, 2005). However, some experts have noted that the effects of relaxation training on the occurrence of target behavior have not been observed to generalize outside treatment sessions ( Adams et al., 2008 and Piacentini and Chang, 2005).

&gt;Competing response training has the aim of rendering performance of the undesirable behavior impossible due to the use of antagonist muscles to the behavior ( O'Connor, 2005). This antagonistic response serves to normalize the behavior by replacing it with a less conspicuous action. Azrin and Nunn (1973) proposed that the competing response should (a) be opposite to the target behavior, (b) be able to be maintained for several minutes ( Woods &amp; Miltenberger, 1995), (c) produce heightened awareness of the behavior though muscle contraction, (d) be socially inconspicuous, (e) be compatible with normal activity, and (f) should strengthen the muscles antagonistic to the target behavior ( Piacentini &amp; Chang, 2005). Competing responses include the following: For tics, isometric tensing of muscles opposite to the tic movement ( Azrin &amp; Peterson, 1990); for stuttering, breathing slowly, deeply, and regularly, relaxing chest and throat muscles, and speaking upon exhaling ( Waterloo &amp; Gotestam, 1988); for thumbsucking, clenching both fists with the thumb inside ( Christensen and Sanders 1987). Adams et al., 2008 and Miltenberger, 2008 describe other competing responses for various repetitive behavior disorders.

&gt;Motivation training techniques are used to enhance the acceptability of HRT to children and their families ( Piacentini &amp; Chang, 2005) and to encourage treatment compliance. The three standard motivational techniques are (a) a habit inconvenience review that involves identification of the impairments, problems and discomforts caused by the habit, (b) social support training involving the recruitment of a person in the client's life to provide encouragement and support (e.g., prompts to use the competing response) in order to aid implementation of the procedures ( Woods, 2006), and (c) public display, involving public performance and demonstration of the client's control of the target behavior.

&gt;Generalization training involves symbolic rehearsal in which the client imagines successful control in situations identified during the awareness stage ( Adams et al., 2008, O'Connor, 2005 and Woods and Miltenberger, 1995). With each situation the client imagines beginning the target behavior, stopping the behavior, and performing the competing response ( Miltenberger, Fuqua, &amp; Woods, 1998

PainMatrix,"The [clinical practice guidelines](http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/update/treating_tobacco_use08.pdf) use a rigorous type of statistical analysis called a meta analysis that demonstrates strong evidence for the effects of medication. Most meds double the likelihood of quitting and these results go out 12 months. You're right there isn't any good data going out beyond that. This starts on page 109 of the actual report, there's a nice table there that summarizes it."
PainMatrix,Interesting to hear that was your perspective of them. I do need to point out that for most people the addition of medications does greatly increase the chance of success.
PainMatrix,"That was the part that stuck out to me too!

&gt;The study also reveals why opioid drugs such as morphine can be ineffective against chronic pain. Morphine and its derivatives normally stimulate the release of dopamine. But in research on mice and rats in chronic pain, Cahill and her colleagues learned that these drugs failed to stimulate a dopamine response, resulting in impaired reward-motivated behavior.

I wonder whether this reduced dopamine response along with neural sensitization plays a role in hyperalgesia related to chronic opioid use."
PainMatrix,"Ah yes:

PainMatrix,I don't see anything. Are you sure you linked the right picture?
PainMatrix,"Hi /u/dcred123, we still aren't exactly sure why and how we dream. What we do know is that we tend to dream more and remember our dreams more vividly during the REM phase of our sleep cycle. 

As to the content of our dreams, there's no definitive answer, but the prevailing theory posits that our brain is organizing and synthesizing all of the inputted information (both actual and emotional content) that it has encountered. We are fairly certain that dreaming helps us to consolidate memories and move them from short to long-term storage. 

Because of the vast array of possible inputs, dream analysis or interpretation in the Freudian sense has been largely discredited. There is a wide array of what would be considered normal/abnormal including being chased by the boogeyman and not being overly bothered by it. "
PainMatrix,"This picture of an MRI scan was a National Geographic picture of the year in 2004. These women are 5'6"" and 250 lbs and 5'5"" and 120 lbs respectively. The yellowish areas are fat deposits and the woman on the left has a large degree of visceral fat (internal fat) around her organs. Visceral fat is the more harmful type of fat as in excess it produces inflammatory proteins that enter the bloodstream and are associated with a number physiological processes that will shorten your lifespan."
PainMatrix,That sounds like a bad *fucking* deal. 
PainMatrix,"The indiegogo page also refers to orbital flight:

PainMatrix,"I wish there was something magical you could do to help your grandmother /u/HiThere333. If she was inpatient psychiatric just recently she most likely underwent thorough evaluation and left with a decent treatment plan. I guess I wonder a couple of things: One, is she actually taking her psychiatric medications, and two, does she have ongoing follow-up psychiatric care. 

In terms of what you can do or say, it sounds to me like you really care about her. One thing I might say is instead of trying to re-assure her (re-assuring typically doesn't help the depressed/anxious and since nobody really knows what the future holds it can be a bit invalidating) is to sympathize with her (e.g. ""I bet it's tough, I wish I had the answers"") concerns and ask her directly if there's anything you can do to help. 

Anyway, those are just some extemporaneous thoughts, good luck. "
PainMatrix,"I wouldn't consider doing any of those things ""stupid shit."" Stupid shit to me means taking risk weighted against caution (e.g. hang-gliding or riding a motorcycle without a helmet, spelunking without proper equipment or maps). Life is for living."

PainMatrix,"Hi /u/put-a-bird-on-it, I wish I had a magic bullet for you. CDC recommendations are to rest during these periods, but [basic sleep hygiene](http://sleepfoundation.org/ask-the-expert/sleep-hygiene) techniques like limiting caffeine can also be helpful for many. Other things to consider outside of your blood-work are your nutrition, body weight, exercise, alcohol &amp; drug use, and mood, as all of these can have an impact on the virus and your level of fatigue. Just as helpful for many patients is psychotherapy to help identify antecedents, exacerbating factors, working on improving mood symptoms as well as becoming more accepting of short-term limitations. "
PainMatrix,"Alcohol has the same effects on REM and deep sleep, but it's even worse for overall sleep architecture because of the withdrawal that occurs several hours in. So, even if you're able to sleep through that (most people with heavy alcohol use are not), the quality of your sleep is going to suffer hugely. If this isn't happening already, it's just a matter of time."
PainMatrix,"That's a great question, no big changes with full catastrophe Living, I can't speak on the newer versions of the other 2 because I have the previous editions of both."

PainMatrix,paging /u/askdoctorsmeeee!
PainMatrix,"so, (/u/smeeee so you're aware that I responded ;), most drugs, including THC, suppress rem sleep, which is about 25% of your sleep cycle. THC also decreases stage 3 sleep (deep sleep). This means that although you may be seemingly sleeping for a long enough period of time, you're not getting an adequate amount of the actual quality sleep your body needs. 

So, that may certainly be a factor, but what I advise most people for their sleep issues is that if you're satisfied and it's not causing a disruption don't overly concern yourself. Get checked out by your pcp first and foremost but as long as you're healthy and clear there is a large spectrum of sleep patterns and there is no such thing as normal. "

PainMatrix,"Ah, I see what you're saying. I realized that it happened after the fact, I'm merely wondering how things would have been different had Candy gotten the role instead."
PainMatrix,Ghostbusters really launched Rick Moranis into the mainstream; it was absolutely enormous. I don't think it's odd to speculate on how things may have played out differently if he didn't get that role. 
PainMatrix,Someone else mentioned that his character from the Vacation movie would have been pretty good. 
PainMatrix,oh I'm sure he would've been fine. It's just that Ghostbusters was really what catapulted his career. It's interesting to think how his career path would probably have looked really different without it.
PainMatrix,Looks like [your recollection is correct](http://www.ksl.com/?sid=24281825). That's pretty awesome.

PainMatrix,"I was interested in the story that was cut off so looked it up:

&gt;Probably the most remarkable 20th-century incidence is that of Angelo Hays, from the village of St Quentin de Chalais in France. In 1937, when he was 19 years old, he was thrown from his motorcycle and hit a brick wall head first. Angelo Hays was declared dead and three days after the accident was buried.

&gt;But in nearby Bordeaux, an insurance firm found that Hay's father had recently insured his son's life for 200,000 francs. An inspector was called to investigate  -  and demanded to have the body exhumed two days after burial to confirm the exact cause of death.

&gt;When the doctor in charge of the autopsy removed the shroud, Hays was found to be warm. He was taken to hospital  -  and after several operations and a long period of rehabilitation recovered completely. His head injury had caused him to slip into deep unconciousness."
PainMatrix,that man certainly marched to the beat of his own drum!

PainMatrix,"Oh right, like that one where all your children but one are burned to death and you just need to figure it out?"
PainMatrix,"&gt;Portugal's low death rate can't be attributable solely to decriminalisation. As Dr. Joao Goulao, the architect of the country's decriminalization policy, has said, ""it's very difficult to identify a causal link between decriminalisation by itself and the positive tendencies we have seen.""

Does anyone know of other data that could potentially lend an answer to this?"

PainMatrix,I kept waiting for a question as I was reading your comment. Instead you just did a really nice job summing up the struggle that many people face and how you're kicking ass. Thank you. 
PainMatrix,Right. A deficit of 500 calories per day will lead to a weight loss of 1 lb per week. However it's not really that little. If you look at these [NHLBI guidelines](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/prctgd_c.pdf) you'll find sample menus that I think are really useful in recognizing that it's actually not that restrictive. 
PainMatrix,Okay I feel like you're dancing around what matters and I'm still not totally getting it...is it humanitarian causes and philanthropy?
PainMatrix,[This report](https://www.presidentschallenge.org/informed/digest/docs/201306digest.pdf) summarizes it. Starting at the end of the third page 
PainMatrix,Thanks!
PainMatrix,"The interesting thing is that physical activity doesn't really confer that much additionally to weight loss. The bulk of the calories we burn comes from metabolic function. Adding a physical activity component to calorie reduction for weight loss in trials only gives an additional 2-5 lbs of weight loss over 6 months. So, the good news is that you can lose weight without being active! That being said, physical activity is one of the most important predictors of weight maintenance (not to mention all of other positive things that it does)"
PainMatrix,"Awesome question; So, we know that [pedometers do work](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=209526#qundefined) to both increase physical activity and reduce BMI. The reason they likely work is because they motivate you and they keep you thinking about activity. The concern with the fitness trackers is that they may not be super-accurate with things like [calories burned](http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2014/06/09/fitnessbands). "

PainMatrix,If [this](http://imgur.com/VYqaFnb) is the alternative I'll take my chances. 
PainMatrix,"This isn't something I knew much about, so I thought I'd do a little digging. So the interesting thing is that there's quite a bit of what I would call expert opinion from physical therapists, physiatrists, etc. but I was unable to find a single actual research study. 

One thing I found that was interesting is that firmness of mattress has an effect. There was [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603147927) that was published in a highly reputable journal showing that patients with nonspecific low back-pain do better and report fewer symptoms with mattresses of medium firmness as opposed to very firm.

PainMatrix,"If you're not having problems with sleep then don't worry about it, some people are more resilient than others!"
PainMatrix,"Interesting question /u/Zaton_PL
First of all, some people are able to fall asleep more quickly than others which comes down to factors related to genetics, neurobiology, sleep setting, and conditioning (to name a few). In regards to sleep position, the answer appears to largely just come down to preference with just a handful of contraindications. According to [this UK survey]( http://bettersleep.org/better-sleep/sleep-positions), 69% of people are side-sleepers,13% are back-sleepers, 7% are stomach sleepers, while the remainder weren’t sure or said it varied. 
We know that back-sleeping is contraindicated in [people with sleep apnea]( http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1985-14905-001), as side-sleeping keeps the airway most open. Research also suggests that if you’re dealing with heart-burn then sleeping on your left side can relieve it while sleeping on your right side can [make it worse](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=410292)."

PainMatrix,"Hi /u/hoursaid, as you're aware nobody on this site can diagnose or treat you, but I'd be happy to give you some information on treatment for body dysmorphic disorder.

[This Cochrane Review](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dan_Stein3/publication/23808834_Pharmacotherapy_and_psychotherapy_for_body_dysmorphic_disorder/links/02e7e51fa2b702344b000000.pdf) from 2009 in general suggests that a combination of medication and psychotherapy can be effective. The behavioral treatment of choice so far is a technique called exposure and response prevention (ERP). 

Exposure therapy involves the construction of homework assignments to expose you to the parts of your body that you’re trying to avoid (e.g. dressing to reveal undesired parts of body, wearing form-fitting clothing, not wearing make-up, etc.). Response prevention follows from this and is all about decreasing body checking behaviors (e.g. looking in the mirror, asking other people how you look, etc.). A common exercise is to set a fixed time for dressing or to refrain from multiple change of clothes. This technique should of course be specifically tailored to the individual.

I also recommend [this website](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/?fa=search_Advanced) in helping to find therapists. Good luck."
PainMatrix,many people aren't able to reconcile electronics with their sleep environment so it's worth looking at.

PainMatrix,"Awesome, I'd be curious to hear about that as well!"
PainMatrix,"I don't know if you read my post over on /r/behavioralmedicine, but you're perfectly describing the bodies adaptive response to pain (tension). I highly recommend a number of relaxation techniques that can help with this, but particularly progressive muscle relaxation. There are a number of stretching techniques that should help with this as well."
PainMatrix,no problem; you want to avoid any bright lights (anything just above being able to read and especially electronics and everything in the blue-wave spectrum); if you do that you shouldn't wake up more.

PainMatrix,Thanks for sharing my comment /u/DCNx. Here's a [link to the post I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) that includes more information.
PainMatrix,"This is fantastic /u/halfascientist, what a great collection of resources! I also fully echo your sentiment that this is one of the most useful skills that a healthcare provider can be trained in. 

For those not in the loop, the underlying assumption of motivational interviewing is that changing health-behaviors (whether it be quitting smoking, starting an exercise routine, or appropriately taking medications) is difficult and often loaded with ambivalence. Motivational interviewing is skillfully recognizing that ambivalence, teasing it out, and having the patient move towards desire and willingness to change their behaviors while simultaneously building their confidence to be successful.

If behavior change were easy, everyone would be doing it."
PainMatrix,"From the conclusions of the study:

&gt;employees at work for a long time may experience fatigue or stress that not only reduces his or her productivity  but also increases the probability of errors, accidents, and sickness th
at impose costs on the  employer.  Unlike the case of fixed employment costs, these concerns over work stress incline the firm not to extend the work hours of employees, but to curtail them.  The point at which fatigue sets  in and the nature of the link
between working hours and work effort or fatigue is likely to vary across types of work and across workers.  

So, it obviously depends on the person and type of work."
PainMatrix,"There was a paper and popular news story a little while back about how [productivity declines the longer you work](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102363524). Output falls sharply after a 50 hour week and someone putting in 70 hours produces nothing more than someone working 55 hours. 

Edit. [Here's the actual paper](http://ftp.iza.org/dp8129.pdf)

Edit 2. Made correction to numbers, thanks to /u/partition_by for cordially pointing out my initial misreading."
PainMatrix,"1. the stimulus control techniques (1-5 that I mentioned in my original comment).
2. exactly. confer with your pcp.
3. There are actually sleep diaries that help you with this based on your ""sleep efficiency."" Typically the way it works is that once you are spending 90% of your time or greater in bed sleeping, that's when you would back up the time."
PainMatrix,"Thanks /u/totallyalive, I'm going to quote Jon Kabat-Zinn on the subject: 

&gt;When we are in the clutches of pain...and medical approaches have not led to reliable relief...it is all too easy to fall into despair and depression.

&gt;The amazing thing...is by paying attention in a particular way to the very sensations, emotions, and thoughts that constitute the experience of pain -- in the present moment and as non-judgmentally as possible...actually has within it the seeds of freedom from suffering...

&gt;[by paying attention to our pain and discomfort]...we come to see what we say to ourselves in the moment (like ""I can't stand this any longer""...""my life is ruined"")...thoughts and emotions which may actually compound the intensity and duration of pain...[we come to think of them] simply as thoughts and emotions.

My own dissertation on the subject suggests that at least one of underlying processes is habituation to the negative stimulus. There are a couple of books on the subject of mindfulness I'd recommend to your pateints: [full catastrophe living](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345536932/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687442&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=1591794641&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=0BGC0Q5ZB6QXRWYRQFXD) and [The mindfulness solution to pain](http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Solution-Pain-Step---Step/dp/1572245816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1433339781&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=mindfulness+solution+to+pain). Hope this was helpful!"
PainMatrix,"Thanks for the nice words, /u/thundahstruck,

There's a pretty intense form of therapy that works pretty well and essentially goes around the issues related to anxiety and falling back asleep. It's called [sleep restriction therapy](http://www.sleepdex.org/restriction.htm)

The term sleep restriction sounds like a paradox; isn’t the purpose of this to increase my sleep, not restrict it? So, thundahstruck here's what people do if they decide to follow it. You start with the time you wake up and then you subtract 5 hours. So want to be up at 6am? New bed-time is 1am. 1-6 is your new sleep window, you follow all other stimulus control techniques during this time as well. Your body is put into a state of exhaustion that it has to take advantage of. Over the course of weeks you slowly back up your bed-time (i.e. 12:45, 12:30, 12:15....) until you're getting decent sleep. This technique in my clinical experience has like a 95% success rate. Good luck!"
PainMatrix,"Just to add to this, physical activity of some kind, any kind. Do jumping jacks while in the studio, take the stairs instead of the elevator etc. Physical activity and decent sleep are going to be the two biggest boosters to your immune system. "
PainMatrix,"To a point. Let's say you have a wife and kids. Would you blow through all of your family's savings for a 2% chance of survival? Probably not. How about half of your family's savings for a 20% chance. Maybe, maybe not, right? It's a decision I wouldn't wish on my enemy."
PainMatrix,ask and ye shall receive!
PainMatrix,What exactly would you want to do?
PainMatrix,This was my original point. 
PainMatrix,"You misunderstand me, the hubris may have been to not do this, but instead to spend all the money on treatments that aren't going to do anything."
PainMatrix,"&gt;I had the choice of either wasting my money on attempting a cure pretty much everybody agreed wouldn’t work, or spending the money on something really useful.

I don't know if it's more hubris or hope, but I'm not sure many people would have made the same decision. "
PainMatrix,I don't think so. 
PainMatrix,Thanks for following up!
PainMatrix,[#77](http://www.reddit.com/r/PerfectTiming/comments/240665/suddenly_a_wild_camera_appeared_gf_i_at_a_music/ch2aiwp) is apparently just a random picture from a music festival. 
PainMatrix,Seriously you can do it. It's a short term sacrifice for a serious long term gain. 
PainMatrix,A large album like this doesn't feel fair. Any one would be moved by at least one of these pictures. 
PainMatrix,It's like when Pleasantville became colorized. 
PainMatrix,YES! Sleep restriction therapy. Google it and you'll find some reasonable links. This is a nearly fool proof treatment if you've got the tenacity to do it. 
PainMatrix,There are such a myriad of issues that might go into this. Check out my post on /r/behavioralmedicine and match it up to your girlfriends sleep habits. 
PainMatrix,"&gt;lets agree to disagree. 

I never mind that as a closing statement. I think I like you. "
PainMatrix,I'm always willing to revisit research but my last major review about 8 months ago suggested to me this method was still reasonable.
PainMatrix,http://www.chacha.com/question/how-hot-is-wasabi-in-scoville-units
PainMatrix,Thanks for the excellent and thorough response /u/halfascientist!
PainMatrix,You're just one step away from being virtually immune to pepper spray!
PainMatrix,"&gt;Marlin Perkins was indirectly accused of being involved in similar controversies, and took umbrage, striking CBC journalist Bob McKeown who challenged Perkins in an interview as to whether he had ever done something of that sort. Perkins, then in his seventies, ""firmly asked for the camera to be turned off, then punched a shocked McKeown in the face.""

I'm not sure if it makes the assertions more believable, or less. "
PainMatrix,"I'm sure many people are familiar with the [Scoville scale](http://imgur.com/kGsWcQ1) as a measure of heat (it actually measures capsaicin). A ghost pepper is approximately 20 times hotter than cayenne and 5-8 times hotter than a habanero pepper. So yeah, it's pretty damn hot. "
PainMatrix,"I can't diagnose you, all I can do is show you the evidence-based behavioral treatment for insomnia. The only thing I didn't touch on here is a technique called sleep restriction therapy (if you google it you should have no problem figuring it out). You also want to definitely rule out anything going on medically (i.e. sleep study and meeting with pcp)"
PainMatrix,"They're terrible swimmers too. I don't know how they're not extinct, they're like an adorable, defense-less little hors d'oeuvre for a larger prey. "
PainMatrix,"first of all, just one night will not make things better; it will take at least 2 weeks on average to see significant improvement. The booze and drugs are suppressing your REM sleep and fragmenting your overall sleep phases so that you are needing more sleep in order to make up for this. Here's what typically works; wait until you're incredibly sleeping before going to bed, even if it's 3am and you have to be up at 7:30, get an alarm clock that you can't snooze. One that you have to get up and shake for 60 seconds to shut the damn thing off. Continue this, for 2 weeks maintaining a consistent wake up time and you will find that as your sleep-wake cycle improves that you will naturally starting becoming tired around 6-7 hours before wake-up time and you'll go to bed improving the quality of your sleep. "
PainMatrix,"went to a clinical psychology PhD graduate program. 4 years of course-work followed by qualifying exams, 1 year of internship followed by a successful dissertation proposal, then 1 year of post-doc, and finally successful completion of a licensing exam"
PainMatrix,"Are you in Sweden by chance? I don't know many countries that prescribe this. The frequent wakening can be due to a number of things. Have you ever had a sleep study done? The body develops a tolerance to nearly all medications over time, so this would be no different; a 25% reduction in your dose could possibly have that effect."
PainMatrix,"sleep restriction therapy. you can google it, the success rate for this is phenomenal."
PainMatrix,for people with a lot of worries I often recommend relaxation strategies and a worry journal for a few minutes before bed. I also sometimes think those sleep accelerometers do more than than good. They're not an accurate assessment of the quality of your sleep and people tend to put a lot of weight on those results.
PainMatrix,"They may overlap, but they're quite distinct. An insomnia from depression would be a secondary insomnia and would likely be alleviated by depression medication. An insomnia induced depression would not be a true depression and so it's less likely that depression medication would help with either that or the sleep."
PainMatrix,As far as I know there is no research on this. In fact there really isn't any good research on any polyphasic sleep schedules. I'm a bit skeptical of the Uberman sleep cycle in particular given that as far as we know we can't really rush the body to complete all of the things it does during sleep.
PainMatrix,absolutely you should. Nearly all insurances cover sleep studies although you sometimes have to jump through some hoops first. 
PainMatrix,Here's a more up to date article http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/4/643.short
PainMatrix,I'd love to see it; my clinical experience has been that it works well.
PainMatrix,"awesome, please do!"
PainMatrix,It's been [done](http://imageserve.babycenter.com/12/000/240/qpD7AzZCMhBO1XMOqlKftmPWrMkT3MVP_lg.jpg)!
PainMatrix,You're describing a hallmark characteristic of insomnia.
PainMatrix,"we're trying to clean up the site; there's been an influx of new people and we are working on it. There is also a difference between a purely behavioral issue (e.g. weight-loss, sleep smoking cessation, etc.), which is what this site deals with and psychopathology (e.g. depression, anxiety, etc.). Furthermore, in your post there wasn't even an actual question but it seemed to be pulling for specific treatment recommendations which we absolutely can't give and I don't want anyone non-professional providing you with information in this area. If you don't live in the United States I would recommend working with your primary care provider as an initial resource."
PainMatrix,It's the act; a comfortable sofa is the same as long as you're only using it for the purposes of sleep and nothing else.
PainMatrix,Have you looked into a pediatric behavior therapist? Many people have found this useful. [Here's a starting point](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/index.cfm?fa=search_advanced)
PainMatrix,"ah, I see what you're saying. Sleep-talking or ""somnliloquy,"" is not all that well understood. It can be specifically related to events that the person is experiencing or it can be generated by a persons imagination. In the case of the person you're describing, my first hypothesis would be that they're having a conversation with someone and they're taking on both sides of this conversation. "
PainMatrix,"One of several things come to mind. One is that maybe you're not getting enough sleep. Another is that your body's natural rhythm is that of a night-owl and mornings are tough. I've had a few patients tell me that they've had good success with [difficult to turn off alarm clocks](http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20506099,00.html). Any treatment decisions should ultimately be made by you and your pcp. "
PainMatrix,"Yes, even with that schedule you can improve things. [Here's a summary](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) of evidence based suggestions to help you improve your sleep. One of the most important is going to be having a consistent wake-up time (even on non-working days)."
PainMatrix,can you extrapolate on what you mean? Like you are yourself and then you become someone else? 
PainMatrix,that makes sense then; the VA has some great treatments for PTSD. I'd highly recommend them!
PainMatrix,"/u/Jamesblond333, I've removed your post due to rule 1. If you're interested in diagnosis and therapy [here is a link](www.abctcentral.org/xFAT) to a website that can assist you."
PainMatrix,"no way of knowing, somehow the tv has become a cued stimulus for sleep for you. that's unusual."
PainMatrix,"It can be relaxing sure, also depends on the materials you're using. If you're using a screen then this can actually make things worse. "
PainMatrix,one night? It's going to be rough for at least a week. If you have clinical depression and anxiety you should be seeing a professional. [Here's a link](www.abctcentral.org/xFAT).
PainMatrix,"That's a great question; They were trying to take a square peg (you) and fit you into a round hole. Sleep studies at best give us an analogous approximation to sleep conditions, but they do tell us a bit about what happens in the brain once you do fall asleep and that can often translate."
PainMatrix,you perfectly described how a primary insomnia develops and worsens. Thanks and good luck.
PainMatrix,sleep restriction therapy. Google it; that's my # 1 recommendation.
PainMatrix,o/
PainMatrix,get up at the same time no matter what! that's the most important thing.
PainMatrix,a lot of people have been talking about this; I don't have any specific advice but you should look into difficult to turn off alarm clocks.
PainMatrix,"thanks for pointing out that the body and the mind are not always on the same page with sleep. definitely get stuff ruled out by a pcp, but even at the same time the behavioral principles of stimulus control therapy and sleep restriction are highly likely to help you."
PainMatrix,"physically, but it takes a while for your sympathetic nervous system to re-achieve homeostatis. Try to avoid exercising within 2 hours of bedtime."
PainMatrix,"1) I couldn't tell you for sure. Take a look at a diagram of the amount of time your body spends in REM sleep, it's only about 25% of the time.
2) I advise embracing the 6. Many people are just fine with this and needlessly stress themselves trying to get more."
PainMatrix,this is tough. I used to work with chronic pain patients and will tell you that most of the experience an improvement in sleep if they're able to do many of the things I recommended over on /r/behavioralmedicine. Look through that post and if you still have other questions let me know.
PainMatrix,I don't; people in other parts of this thread and over on /r/behavioralmedicine have recommended various types of difficult to turn off alarm clocks. 
PainMatrix,"In both my clinical experience (and the research supports this), the more physical that people are (whether it's labor or the gym) the better they tend to sleep."
PainMatrix,it's not unusual; some people are really resilient with this and others not so much. There's a wide spectrum.
PainMatrix,"Remember that the most important thing is not bed-time, but wake-up time; you want to be pretty tired out before going to bed."
PainMatrix,because there's good evidence that this works with no negative [effects](http://www.med.umich.edu/pediatrics/ebm/cats/ferber.htm)
PainMatrix,"Does it help? I think that's an important point. Also, I've often recommended a worry record before bed where you spend a few minutes before bed getting out all of your thoughts. If you're dealing with significant anxiety then I'd recommend [CBT](www.abctcentral.org/xFAT)."
PainMatrix,I would suspect it can; there's a release of hormones when you orgasm that are associated with relaxation. Anecdotally I've also heard people say it works for them.
PainMatrix,that's a great question and I wish I had an answer but don't know of any research; I like your theory though!
PainMatrix,no problem; it does for many people because it releases hormones that help you to relax.
PainMatrix,"There's no great specific research on this, which is why as a general rule we don't recommend it. Ambient light and direct light seem to have different effects. "
PainMatrix,"It's definitely unusual, but not unheard of."
PainMatrix,thanks!
PainMatrix,you may not be getting enough sleep.
PainMatrix,"on average, 2"
PainMatrix,someone else mentioned this as well; it's nothing I know about.
PainMatrix,"sex is okay in the bed, sorry should've mentioned that."
PainMatrix,"no, not for most people; our bodies do a lot of important stuff when we sleep and that process  can't be rushed. That said, some people are fine on 6 hours (although that's on the lower end)"
PainMatrix,I'd always recommend the behavioral techniques first and foremost. Some people do fine by sleeping in on the weekends but most with insomnia do not and need a consistent wake-up time every day.
PainMatrix,yes I do!
PainMatrix,until you're good and tired again.
PainMatrix,"you're reversing it a bit, when the body prepares for sleep it's basal temperature drops so that cooler temperatures feel more comfortable. "
PainMatrix,"you're not going to want to hear this, but your wake-up time should be consistent, that's the most important thing. If you get up at 0500 or 0600 every day your circadian rhythm will fall into place and you'll feel well rested."
PainMatrix,you should push it. If you're consistent with a 7am wake up time most people shouldn't be going to bed before 11 (subtract 8 hours) and ideally not until midnight. After a couple of weeks of 12-7 your sleep-wake cycle should fall into place.
PainMatrix,I'm trying to help and don't really appreciate the sarcasm. By doing this you exhaust yourself to the point where you essentially pass out. This is the beginning of creating a new association with the bed and falling asleep quickly. For most people it takes about 2 weeks to see significant improvement.
PainMatrix,exactly. If you don't have a sleep problem most people can get away with sleeping in once in a while.
PainMatrix,give it time to heal and feel better; then you can worry about it. These rules don't apply when you're sick or recovering.
PainMatrix,could just be associative; she's a cued stimulus for you.
PainMatrix,at first. give it 2 weeks and stay consistent with your wake-up time.
PainMatrix,"I'm not against drugs per se, but pot inhibits REM sleep for most people."
PainMatrix,Not that I've heard; in fact I think feeling relaxed would even be helpful.
PainMatrix,done. http://np.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/387lb6/iama_clinical_health_psychologist_with_expertise/
PainMatrix,maybe. you just may be resilient too; not everyone is predisposed to developing sleep issues.
PainMatrix,"reading, meditating, puzzles.."
PainMatrix,"in older children (5 and up), yes."
PainMatrix,usually 2 weeks.
PainMatrix,not sure; could be a time-dependent tolerance thing going on.
PainMatrix,"see your pcp; in lieu of any medical conditions you can re-condition yourself to do this. don't oversleep, in fact think of sleeping in no more than 6-7 hour increments and not getting a ""decent"" nights sleep for a while."
PainMatrix,"not stimulating; anything relaxing, reading, meditating, etc."
PainMatrix,"got into psychology, went to grad school for health psychology, enjoyed working with sleep, am writing a workbook on it."
PainMatrix,see your pcp
PainMatrix,done http://np.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/387lb6/iama_clinical_health_psychologist_with_expertise/
PainMatrix,exactly; there's no good research on this.
PainMatrix,until you're so exhausted you don't stand a chance...
PainMatrix,couch
PainMatrix,sex is the exception
PainMatrix,the behavioral techniques and light therapy; 
PainMatrix,the techniques are well known; this study showed that it can also be used for people have only been dealing with sleep issues for a short time.
PainMatrix,"most people can't handle that, but some can. if you feel rested and you're satisfied that's the most important thing."
PainMatrix,"stay in bedroom but at least get out of bed, go to a chair, the floor, anything."
PainMatrix,"need to keep the light dim, like just being able to make out the words."
PainMatrix,exactly
PainMatrix,most people can train themselves to fall asleep within 20 minutes. So total time laying in bed for a nap would be 50 minutes.
PainMatrix,"Hey /u/browup396, there really is no evidence-based method for this; all of this discussion on biphasic sleep is based on historical anecdotal evidence and a single study performed by Thomas Wehr in the early 90's that consisted of only seven individuals."
PainMatrix,You're getting professional help which is great; She's also old enough that many of the behavioral principles that are linked in my top post may be effective for her.
PainMatrix,"Good stuff, thanks!"
PainMatrix,[sleep restriction](http://www.sleepdex.org/restriction.htm). You pick your wake-up time and you subtract 5 hours (or so). That's your new bed-time. Following the other behavioral principles I discussed many people have had success.
PainMatrix,There are websites with reviews but of course many therapists aren't on them since they would be consumer generated. I always recommend the [ABCT](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/) find a therapist portal as a starting place. 
PainMatrix,hypersalivation can be related to a number of things. You should make an appointment with your pcp.
PainMatrix,"I've heard scheduled awakenings have worked well for many people; you could have your boyfriend help you identify the times that you're most likely to sleepwalk and then set an alarm for 10-15 minutes before the episode. Also, stress management helps many, [here's](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/) a therapist finder that could help if you're interested."
PainMatrix,There may be internship opportunities available but if you want to work independently as a therapist I don't know of any job opportunities below masters levels.
PainMatrix,"Do you ever fall asleep unwillingly, like when you don't mean to? If not, I'd regard this as a bit of a mundane superpower that you have. If you're concerned you should always bring it up with your pcp."
PainMatrix,"Hey, /u/anime_club, you're certainly not alone; approximately 7% of the population suffers from parureris. Pelvic floor physical therapy is sometimes recommended for this. I've also heard anecdotally people telling me that if they try to relax their pelvic muscles and visualize their urine coming out it helps. Good luck. "
PainMatrix,"Hey /u/Jlgwrestler, I recommend meeting with a therapist to help you identify your anger and to slow down the process so that it doesn't get you in trouble. [Here's a great resource](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/) for finding one."
PainMatrix,"&gt;Would it be possible to somehow implement that into a healthy sleeping schedule? 

Yes, in fact if you follow sound behavioral principles many people improve the overall quality of your sleep. So, even they wake up during the night to go to the bathroom, the time spent actually sleeping is better."
PainMatrix,You should definitely get lab-work done to rule out any medical issues first and foremost. Good luck.
PainMatrix,"Hey /u/daily_drivel, 

We can't provide diagnosis or treatment here, but it sound like you could benefit from talking this through with a professional. I highly recommend [ABCT](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/)'s therapist finder. They're an organization that provides CBT, an evidence-based therapy."
PainMatrix,Thanks for linking that /u/nixiedust. The most important thing in sleep is that you're feeling rested and okay. There are many different ways people have of getting there. 
PainMatrix,"What a great question from a very apropos username. The ""I need it"" is actually a sign of psychological dependence over physical. I would highly recommend slowly mixing decaf into your caffeinated until you've weaned yourself off. Do this over the course of several weeks. I can almost guarantee that your body won't know the difference and the good thing is that neither will you. "
PainMatrix,"You should be getting up at the same time every day. Your circadian rhythm will start to catch up and after a while you will sleep better and wake refreshed, even at 530. "
PainMatrix,"As a general rule, the more time you spend in bed awake the more likely you are to have problems sleeping. "
PainMatrix,Nope. Average time is about 7 minutes but there's a lot of variability. 
PainMatrix,I would honestly doubt this would be an issue.
PainMatrix,get up until you're really tired and then try again.
PainMatrix,happy cake day :)
PainMatrix,non-stimulating (subjective)
PainMatrix,it's not possible. He's underestimating. Even 4-5 is possible but very rare.
PainMatrix,probably okay; you're saying you have sleep problems but you're also using pot; pot suppresses REM sleep..FYI
PainMatrix,"A lot of redditors swear by these, I honestly have no idea."
PainMatrix,no problem = no problem
PainMatrix,"no electronic screens. subjective, non-stimulating, reading, puzzles, cross-words, etc."
PainMatrix,you're trying to sleep too much. You don't need more than 6-7 hours.
PainMatrix,"not harmful, but often not helpful, follow my thread in /r/behavioralmedicine."
PainMatrix,"funny, i typically recommend a white noise machine; I can't think of a way to change this but I'd recommend relaxation techniques (e.g. meditation, diaphragmatic breathing) beforehand to relax."
PainMatrix,that's tough but greater distance from bed = better.
PainMatrix,"Hey Adam, check out my post on /r/behavioralmedicine. If that doesn't help you within 2-3 weeks, follow up with your pcp."
PainMatrix,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008210001759
PainMatrix,you may feel like you have a poor perception but I guarantee that you would be able to figure it out within 5-10 minutes. that's good enough.
PainMatrix,if you follow my guidelines on /r/behavioralmedicine it should improve the quality of your sleep so you don't wake as easily!
PainMatrix,"most drugs suppress REM sleep, I think that's what you're asking."
PainMatrix,You've got a tough problem; weight management first and foremost if that's an issue. At the same time I would look into CBT for stress/anxiety issues.
PainMatrix,don't know about it...but if it works!
PainMatrix,low key is non-stimulating (subjective); more than 2 drinks for a male after dinner will interfere with sleep and electronics within an hour of bedtime are also likely to interfere.
PainMatrix,"I'm sorry, don't have a good answer to this without tons more information including lab-work"
PainMatrix,follow my advice in /r/behavioralmedicine.
PainMatrix,that's a great question. Can you pay me?
PainMatrix,"I often recommend a white noise machine, like a fan."
PainMatrix,do all of the things I mentioned first.
PainMatrix,"non-stimulating; it's subjective; reading, meditating, etc."
PainMatrix,"non-stimulating; it's subjective; reading, meditating, etc."
PainMatrix,I often recommend writing down your worry thoughts before bed. seriously. take some worry time and try it.
PainMatrix,"Not that harmful, seem helpful for many."
PainMatrix,non-stimulating; it's subjective. 
PainMatrix,"Follow my rules over in /r/behavioralmedicine, but aside from that you may want to accept it to a certain extent. Sleep cycles happen in about 90 minute increments and it's in between that we tend to wake up (like you). "
PainMatrix,"I spoke with someone else about scheduled awakenings. I'd also recommend relaxation strategies, proper nutrition, and physical activity."
PainMatrix,That really shouldn't be a major inhibitor with kids (they don't carry all the baggage we do).
PainMatrix,I think most people have a pretty good internal clock. whatever works for you.
PainMatrix,could be a number of things; stress is often related
PainMatrix,"anything non-stimulating, it's subjective, reading, meditation, puzzles, whatever."
PainMatrix,"alcohol inhibits REM sleep and causes tons of other problems throughout the night. This may at least be a contributory factor to your ""shut my mind off"" thing."
PainMatrix,"yes, b/c you'd be exhausted."
PainMatrix,"ha ha, of course; sleep tends to get redistributed as we age, but we still need just as much and these tactics work."
PainMatrix,"if you don't have insomnia it's fine, if you do, then not good."
PainMatrix,greater the distance the better; at least a chair if you can.
PainMatrix,I think you know the answer ;)
PainMatrix,"yes, just keep it low key. I work for the VA btw; there are great resources available to you if you're US"
PainMatrix,sounds like you're largely doing okay
PainMatrix,bad idea; you want to do something non-stimulating. wait 2 hours after exercise before bed.
PainMatrix,bad idea; you want to do something non-stimulating. wait 2 hours after exercise before bed.
PainMatrix,"low key, don't stimulate yourself."
PainMatrix,low stimulation; it's personally subjective
PainMatrix,do it.
PainMatrix,Thanks. I've got 300 outstanding messages to read and am trying to do my best.
PainMatrix,If anyone has any background or expertise in any fields related to physical or mental health please pm the mods for flair; we welcome your expertise!
PainMatrix,Aside from the stimulus control techniques I mentioned I also strongly recommend sleep restriction therapy for those wanting to seriously improve things quickly. To deal with the stress and anxiety I would highly encourage you to seek help for this. [The ABCT find a therapist portal](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/?fa=search_Advanced) is a good resource for those interested.
PainMatrix,"hey /u/ohshitagirl, I think you're looking at a couple of different things. First, cynicism means that you think everyone's just out for themselves. You said you've done CBT before. Do you think **everyone** is out for themselves? (all or nothing thinking, right?). 

The other thing you're touching on is that your personal values don't jive with those of the people around you. So, 1) is there any common ground or shared interests that you do have and can just be okay with leaving it at that, and 2) are there opportunities to find like-minded people in your area? 

I recommend the [ABCT find a therapist portal](http://www.abctcentral.org/xFAT/?fa=search_Advanced) for those interested in CBT treatment."
PainMatrix,I would say that's a very good possibility. There are several questionnaires that assess night owl vs. early bird. The [morningness-eveningness questionnaire](http://www.chem.unt.edu/~./djtaylor/extra/meq.pdf) has fairly good validity. Would you take it and report back your findings?
PainMatrix,"medications are an option if this is a significant issue; I would recommend relaxation techniques and stress reduction as /u/swiftpolarbear points out. There's also a technique called anticipatory awakening; I'm not all that familiar with it, but it would involve waking you up just prior to the onset of the episode. Apparently this has been effective in some patients. "
PainMatrix,"oh yes. I wrote university health center because most college students don't have a physician. You do, which is awesome!"
PainMatrix,"Concentration difficulties can result from any number of medical or psychiatric conditions. The more common psychiatric ones that come to mind are stress, anxiety, and depression. I can't diagnose you and I'm sorry that there's not going to be a quick fix for this, but I would highly recommend following up with your university health center to get a work-up done."
PainMatrix,primary insomnia is purely conditioned and behavioral. Insomnia can also be secondary and related to things like circadian rhythm disorders. I'd recommend maybe a sleep study and a discussion with your pcp.
PainMatrix,This is tricky with toddlers. I typically recommend the Ferber method to parents.
PainMatrix,"No! Great question. Only go to bed when very sleepy, the time can (and will) vary."
PainMatrix,same thing applies. check out my post over on /r/behavioralmedicine as well.
PainMatrix,exercise and proper nutrition. If that's not doing it and you're following the guidelines I posted over on /r/behavioralmedicine I might recommend a sleep study.
PainMatrix,I don't know about any research on this. I often recommend white-noise to patients though.
PainMatrix,"the light from your monitor inhibits melatonin production in your brain. I've heard there are screens that can filter out the blue wavelength (which is the most harmful). I recommend 1 hour of wind-down time prior to bed (no screens, light-reading, puzzles, meditating, warm bath, etc.)"
PainMatrix,I haven't heard the no food one and can't think of a reason why that would make a difference (unless you're overeating and get indigestion). Clinical guidelines are to not work out at least 2 hour before bedtime.
PainMatrix,"I wouldn't recommend it; not because I'm against it but because it inhibits REM sleep, a vital component of sleep that allows for memory consolidation among many other things."
PainMatrix,same rules apply when you wake up in the night. 
PainMatrix,I kind of feel like I'm doing one now.
PainMatrix,as long as they're not gassy (e.g. broccoli) or caffeinated (e.g. chocolate) food can be helpful for people that wake up hungry.
PainMatrix,"follow the same advice including my suggestions over on /r/behavioralmedicine. Engage in some relaxation techniques (e.g. meditation), and don't go to bed too early. that's a mistake a lot of people make."

Pretty sure this is one."
PainMatrix,If you're falling all of this (including my post on /r/behavioralmedicine) then there may be something else going on and you should speak to your pcp who may recommend a sleep study.
PainMatrix,"exactly, anything that isn't sleep or sex."

I'm pretty sure I am."
PainMatrix,"all of the context of your room is associated with being awake when you have insomnia, the further from that context the better but definitely getting out of bed is better than nothing."
PainMatrix,sexy times is no problem.
PainMatrix,the first night. Then it would be a little better the second night and so on and so forth. It's a short-term sacrifice for a long-term gain.
PainMatrix,sleep hygiene is different but related.
PainMatrix,light in general does because the wavelengths inhibit melatonin production.
PainMatrix,"sleep restriction therapy. google it, highly recommendable."
PainMatrix,for some people this is a non-issue. But if you have sleep difficulties I wouldn't recommend it. If you don't...read on.
PainMatrix,nope. sounds like you're doing fine.
PainMatrix,try to only spend a few minutes at a time on the thing that makes you sleepy and then do something stimulating (like jumping jacks...seriously) to reverse that association.
PainMatrix,"yes, someone else asked about this; I recommend the stimulus control techniques I mentioned, relaxation strategies, proper nutrition and exercise, and stay away from stimulants. If all else fails get a sleep study done."
PainMatrix,"it's subjective, but non-stimulating and no exposure to electronic screens."
PainMatrix,"&gt;is this detrimental

It's temporary and there should be no long-term damage from this. I'm actually working on a book about dealing with sleep loss when you have kids that won't sleep but it's not done. There are some great techniques for helping kids sleep (e.g. Ferber method)"
PainMatrix,Lay in bed from illness doesn't seem to be an interfering factor.
PainMatrix,yes!
PainMatrix,follow all my advice [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) for 2 weeks. For most people that works.
PainMatrix,"If you feel yourself getting sleep, get up; you should be doing sleep incompatible activities if you're feeling tired and it's not bed time."
PainMatrix,"Get up at the same time EVERY day, no matter what. This is at the crux of your circadian rhythm."
PainMatrix,"Teach yourself some relaxation techniques if you can; I just recommended the Relaxation &amp; Stress Reduction Workbook by Davis to someone else, but you can find tons of stuff online. Just don't lay in bed for more than 15 minutes and if you feel your heart beating like that get out of bed right away!"
PainMatrix,a chair in the room. Greater distance from bed the better.
PainMatrix,subjective feeling of low stimulation preferably with no electronics.
PainMatrix,"ask yourself if you feel very sleepy or are having a hard time getting through the day? If not, it's not a big deal."
PainMatrix,"diaphragmatic breathing, visualization, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation. I'd recommend The Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook by Davis, Eshelman, and McKay."
PainMatrix,those are no fun! Improvements in nutrition and exercise as well as reduction in stimulants have all been shown to help as have [using behavioral techniques.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/)
PainMatrix,you're a statistical anomaly.
PainMatrix,you're the 4th person to ask this so let me just edit my comment. (but sex is okay)
PainMatrix,awesome! The average person takes 7 minutes to fall asleep so you're hitting the bullseye!
PainMatrix,have sex everywhere! This includes the bed though and this is an exception because of the release of hormones associated with feeling good and relaxation (e.g. oxytocin).
PainMatrix,"tl;dr: no!

That would be a pretty nice illness to have wouldn't it? There are case-reports of people who purportedly don't need more than 4-5 hours of sleep, but this is very rare and not at all well understood. There is a reason we need sleep, it repairs the body and replenishes brain functioning and most people need between 6 and 8, there is no research to suggest that we can train our bodies to complete these processes more quickly."
PainMatrix,yes! this should be used in the middle of the night as well!
PainMatrix,I just wrote a more full-fledged [post on /r/behavioralmedicine](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) that help people with chronic pain as well. Feel free to ask questions over there about chronic pain also.
PainMatrix,"ha ha, I mentioned it to a couple of others, but sex is the exception because of the associated release in positive and relaxing hormones (e.g. oxytocin). But definitely, have sex everywhere! It should be fun!"
PainMatrix,"As long as you're not having a sleep issue, good for you."
PainMatrix,definitely!

PainMatrix,I'm not sure what this is a reference to; it's not based on any clinical or evidence-based practice that I'm aware of.
PainMatrix,"non-stimulating, low arousal; it's subjective, but reading, meditating, puzzles... (not electronics)"
PainMatrix,"&gt;Mostly I want confirmation that things like this do happen. That there are some people who don't fall into circadian rhythms

Leading up to your last comment this was exactly what was on my mind. Give up the notion that you need more than 5-6 hours of sleep. You're most likely just fine with that. There's a wide spectrum of what can be considered normal when it comes to sleep!"
PainMatrix,it takes most people about 2 weeks of consistent practice until things are reset. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) a fuller version of my recommendations.
PainMatrix,That's tough because you want to avoid light exposure. Can you fit a chair/recliner in your room that you can use instead of just laying in bed?
PainMatrix,"I didn't note many things because there are many factors at play, and it's highly individualistic, but yes, light exposure (particularly blue wave-lengths) is problematic."
PainMatrix,Yes! Although I wouldn't recommend slapping yourself you get the picture.
PainMatrix,Sex is the exception because of the associated release with pleasant hormones (e.g. oxytocin).
PainMatrix,[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) a fuller version of my recommendations.
PainMatrix,At least use a chair for other stuff.
PainMatrix,"I hope it's working. The wave-lengths associated with blue-light are the most harmful, the ones with red, the least."
PainMatrix,"you should; most people can't get away with this; you're on the far end of the spectrum, congrats AND I'm jealous."
PainMatrix,"bingo. get a comfortable chair, anything that is not your bed."
PainMatrix,[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/) more info.
PainMatrix,Doesn't matter; just shift things for your schedule.
PainMatrix,"have a wind-down time; at least 1 hour beforehand where you start doing relaxing things (e.g. warm-bath, meditation, light-reading)."
PainMatrix,Sex and cuddling are the exception to this because of the positively associated and relaxing hormones released (e.g. oxytocin)
PainMatrix,I wrote a post over on /r/behavioralmedicine [on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/). The other thing that I would recommend for you would be [sleep restriction therapy](http://www.talkaboutsleep.com/sleep-restriction-therapy-when-nothing-else-works/) to reset your body's sleep-wake cycle.
PainMatrix,as long as you feel okay many people get by on 6 hours.
PainMatrix,"It is, but the narcolepsy is the primary issue and would need to be treated first. Behavioral techniques can help with this, but there are also pharmacological options you can pursue with your pcp."
PainMatrix,"yes! Ideally, the further away from your bedroom the better, but at least out of the bed!"
PainMatrix,Try to distinguish your sleep environment from everything else as much as possible.
PainMatrix,yes! At any point in the night
PainMatrix,then you're the exception; it sounds like you don't have a sleep issue either though.
PainMatrix,yes!
PainMatrix,"great question; it's subjective, so if you feel like the activity is not ""arousing"" it's probably okay. Many of my patients read books, do puzzles, crafts, crosswords, even just sitting and doing nothing. But YES, a major caveat would be to not expose your eyes to light of moderate intensity, including screens."
PainMatrix,"everyone's different, but most people can't get away with this."
PainMatrix,I just wrote a more lengthier post [over on /r/behavioralmedicine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3835uy/behavioral_approaches_to_getting_over_insomnia/). Let me know if you have any more questions after reading through it. 
PainMatrix,"yeah, there's actually a correlation between intelligence and sleep difficulties, possibly related to the reason that as you said ""the brain won't stop thinking."""
PainMatrix,"He doesn't have a problem with you in your room because his brain has created an association with his own sleep environment and staying awake. Since that association doesn't exist in your bedroom it's not an issue. If he's an anxious kid and tends to worry about things I'd talk him fully through his concerns (i.e. what is he **really** worried about), and perhaps even teach him some relaxation exercises to calm down his body and mind (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing.)"
PainMatrix,Bingo
PainMatrix,"Absolutely. The more time people spend in bed awake the more likely they are to develop insomnia. The goal should be to spend no more than 10-15% of your time in bed awake (that consists of the time it takes to fall asleep). 

Edit. I keep getting asked about this but sex is the exception to this because of the positively associated and relaxing hormones released (e.g. oxytocin)"
PainMatrix,"Hey OP, I'm a clinical health psychologist with expertise in insomnia and sleep. We know it's actually realistic to train most people to fall asleep within 15-20 minutes through stimulus control techniques. Essentially what you do is this: 

- if you're not asleep within 15 minutes get out of bed and go to another room
- do something low key 
- when you feel tired go back to bed and try again. If you're not asleep within 15 minutes get out of bed again.
- repeat as often as necessary. 

Eventually your brain cries uncle and you fall asleep. This strengthens the association with the bed and falling asleep quickly so over time this will happen more often the first time around. Feel free to ask me any questions and if you have any other health related questions or interests come visit us over in /r/behavioralmedicine. I just wrote a post there with some more detailed information on improving sleep as well.

Edit. I'm getting a little overwhelmed with the questions (and have to do my actual job for a little while). I'll do my best to answer everything in the next 24 hours."

PainMatrix,**DON'T TRY TO CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!**

PainMatrix,"I'm not saying it's a competition. I just want to be clear that this includes everyone, we all have more work and less leisure time than we did 50 years ago. To me, that's the real issue and discussion of gender is just a red herring. "

EDIT. you changed your response to me just so everyone is clear. Your first response was a very reasonable claim that statistically women are more often primary caregivers. "
PainMatrix,"&gt;far more dads **help** out

I really thought we were past this. My wife and I both work full time, share cleaning and cooking responsibilities as well as all duties related to childcare. I know I'm not alone in this and yet men are still perceived as being the adjunct carers of their children. "
PainMatrix,I'm more curious about the context of that first picture. Why is the cat standing in water seemingly rolling a watermelon to dry land?
PainMatrix,"Howard Friedman is a well known health psychologist. This longitudinal study on longevity found in part that people who are more optimistic don't live as long: people who are highest in optimism are more likely to take risks since they minimize the harm that could befall them.

PainMatrix,"I know you're curious about the MDs, but for psychologists this falls under the portion of our ethics code called ""multiple relationships."" Having a patient as a friend would be considered unethical if it impairs ""objectivity, competence or effectiveness in performing....functions as a psychologist, or otherwise risks exploitation or harm to the person with whom the professional relationship exists.""

So it's up to the discretion of the psychologist as long as they don't think it will cloud their thinking or harm the person. "
PainMatrix,"I think this is what makes it better. I can always buy a McDonald's cheeseburger, it's good but it holds no real gastronomic value to me. But maki, nigiri and sashimi... The fact that it is a rare and special treat just enhances it. "
PainMatrix,"Awesome post /u/getcapefly!

You actually present 2 different questions. First, which chronic illnesses can be significantly improved by behavior change. Simply put, and without hyperbole, nearly all of them. Take cancer for example, a disease that we think of as being ""purely medical"" can be significantly hastened by [stress and depression](http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/14/health/stress-cancer-survival-enayati/)! (I'm intentionally linking the popular report as opposed to the journals, but the research articles are easily found within the article). 

The second question that you posed is which illnesses can be improved by behavior as opposed to pharmacology, and I think the answer to that is incredibly varied and complex. I don't think anyone would argue however that there is not at least a role in cognitive/behavioral change in every illness. 

Very simply put: You get sick...you feel stress and depressed...your immune system is compromised...worsening of illness...increasing stress and depression...etc. 

Thanks for the links to those great articles /u/getcapefly!"

PainMatrix,If you're a cyclist a co2 tube and extra tire.

PainMatrix,"Clinical health psychologist here with specialty in weight management. Without exercise at all I would err on this being at minimum very unsafe and possibly deadly. NIH recommendations are that 1-2 lbs per week of weight loss are feasible which means about 27 lbs max in 3 months (25kg = 55 lbs). This means that the person is restricting their caloric intake by about 1,000kc per day. Doubling that would mean a restriction of 2,000kc per day which would almost certainly mean significant health problems if not outright death. "
PainMatrix,"Jdawg, thanks so much for your question and belief in this sub :). Let me start off by saying that your history with social anxiety will in no way be an impediment to becoming a clinical psychologist, in fact I think it gives you a certain edge long term in regards to understanding your patients. I also think graduate school will be really helpful for your anxiety because as we know the best treatment is exposure and you will get tons of that in school. I'm kinda wired the same way and I always think of Eleanor Roosevelts famous line, ""do something every day that scares you."" If you're not I don't think you're truly living. 

Now, with all of that said this is nothing you want to advertise when applying for graduate school. Would you go into a job interview listing all of your ""weaknesses?"" Obviously not, and it's the same here. I'm sure there are many great and wonderful strengths that you have that you should highlight. Please let me know if you have any additionall questions. "

PainMatrix,"The truth is that if you wanted to cover every aspect of the discipline **thoroughly** you would need degrees in psychology, physiology, neurology, biology, and immunology just for starters. I'm a clinical health psychologist which means that I got training particularly in the psychological aspects of it with an added emphasis on the interplay between psychology, sociology, and biology and how these things influence health and illness. This APA [website discusses it further](http://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/health.aspx). Here is a [partial list of programs that specialize in this](http://www.health-psych.org/Clinicalprograms.cfm)"
PainMatrix,"Thanks so much for asking /u/kuekuatsu813, there's been some confusion about that on this sub. Behavioral medicine is about the understanding, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of illness through behavioral and psychosocial techniques. 

The Annals Of Behavioral Medicine (one of the premier journals in the field) states:

&gt; the integration of biological, psychosocial, and behavioral factors and principles as they relate to such areas as health promotion, disease prevention, risk factor modification, disease progression, adjustment and adaptation to physical disorders, and rehabilitation.

Professionals in this discipline may be incredibly varied and include a broad range of medical and mental health professionals whose underlying goal it is to improve health and functioning using a variety of techniques. I hope that goes some way to answering your question."

My honest prediction (if the human race is to survive at all) is that corn and fructose production will be cut way back and that eating in the future will largely be a matter of necessity."
PainMatrix,I don't know any particular precedents for combining the two but that's not going to stop me from giving my two cents :) There is a huge future in psychology for app and program-based adjunct therapy. I honestly think I'm underplaying it when I say that it's enormous. If you can learn skills that help you to understand the creation of these kinds of platforms and then work with others to tailor existing interventions I think you're tapping into something we'll see a lot more of.
PainMatrix,"Nice answer, thanks!"
PainMatrix,"Hi /u/jwarubu22, behavioral medicine involves modification of behaviors to improve health outcomes without using pharmacology.

PainMatrix,"I don't really know all that much about it, but [this article](http://psychology.about.com/od/psychotherapy/f/therapist.htm) looks like it can give you a start. "
PainMatrix,"Sweet, welcome aboard, I'll flare you!"
PainMatrix,"I was in the same boat, didn't actually start making real money until I was 32 and I also have loans. It's a tough choice. "
PainMatrix,They mention him in the article. He was never officially declared a 6-star general but it was all done with a wink and a nod. 
PainMatrix,"
&gt;You're the expert but I've always thought that psychology isn't struggling to become a science, it's more that it's struggling to have people recognize it as one. There was a good thread about it on /r/science last week I think.

Thank you. Psychology is a science today, but what I meant was that it wasn't in the past. 

&gt;Good to know that I don't have to enter research. I really want a solid background in it because it seems important for practice, plus I enjoy it. Thanks for the help!

You're welcome!"
PainMatrix,I said in my post. 
PainMatrix,"Yes, but that has nothing to do with behavioral medicine. "
PainMatrix,Without a doubt!
PainMatrix,At this point it comes down to what is important to you and weighing your interests with real world practicality. 
PainMatrix,"Behavioral medicine is the interdisciplinary field concerned with the development and integration of behavioral, psychosocial, and biomedical science knowledge and techniques relevant to the understanding of health and illness, and the application of this knowledge and these techniques to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation."
PainMatrix,Med school typically require more biology intensive courses as an undergrad than psychology. Make sure you check on that. 
PainMatrix,I could imagine the Hogwarts Express making its way through there. 
PainMatrix,Day old newspapers and regret :(
PainMatrix,"You're not annoying me at all, what is it that you want to eventually do?"
PainMatrix,"Welcome aboard, looking forward to your contributions :)"
PainMatrix,"hey /u/gumeez, I don't think anyone can make that decision but you. Who knows, you may find that after spending more time and money you're not even happy. I'm all for following your heart but with a healthy dose of practicality as well. "
PainMatrix,"Yes! In fact clinical psychology would be your first choice if you were interested in this. Although, just to clarify, are you talking about psychopathology (the study of mental disorders) or psychopaths (a specific form of psychopathology)? Either way, clinical psychology would be the field to get into."
PainMatrix,"Awesome, happy to inspire whenever possible!"
PainMatrix,you have to realize that there are a lot of unqualified people applying to programs that aren't good matches. If you're qualified and a decent match you stand a good chance!
PainMatrix,that's definitely an option. It totally depends on what you want to do.
PainMatrix,"Done! Thanks for subbing, hope to hear from you! :)"
PainMatrix,You'd want to veer heavily on the BS side I would think but I don't really know what the undergrad requirements are for med school.
PainMatrix,I wish I could. I've been working for the government for almost 7 years so I don't have my finger too close to the pulse of the job market these days. 
PainMatrix,"Awesome, it's a fantastic and burgeoning field! Here's some advice I posted [to someone else](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37c2p3/high_schoolers_what_do_you_want_to_major_in/crlj0ow)"

PainMatrix,I'm a clinical health psychologist working at the VA! Welcome aboard the sub!
PainMatrix,Thanks for the suggestion jlsmit15! Let's reach out to them!
PainMatrix,"Here's the deal, it's not going to hurt you, but it may slow you down. "
PainMatrix,"I can't speak for all. Bureau of labor says its a growing field, but there's a lot of competition!"
PainMatrix,"No, if you're looking to get into clinical psychology, then getting an MSW is going to be a major detour. You want to go straight to a phd program."
PainMatrix,"wow, just awesome. You made my whole day. Just glad I could be that someone for you. 

Just to let you know, after my shitty start I put a giant poster on the wall above my bed, ""3.5."" I looked at that poster multiple times per day and never went below it. "
PainMatrix,"Depends. If you're in academia you start at like 60,000 but if you're a statistician you can start at like twice that!"
PainMatrix,Thought this would be a good popular science article by a PhD to start things off in this sub. Can't wait to see more submissions!
PainMatrix,Thank you so much for being one of the first subscribers schmel512!
PainMatrix,good luck to you!
PainMatrix,"totally, trust me I was a fuck up early on. If I can make it I have no doubt that you can :)"
PainMatrix,Thanks for being the very first comment /u/picspicspics222! Nice to find fellow like-minded people as well :). If anyone would like flair I'd be happy to give it!
PainMatrix,"not bad, thanks /u/ninja47!"
PainMatrix,If you're talking an average of 61.5% at this point then you're not a good candidate just based on that. But if it's intro psych and you're early in your program then you should have plenty of opportunity to build it up. I had a 2.2 total the first 3 semesters of my undergraduate career before I got my shit together. 
PainMatrix,"It may seem cliched but I took an abnormal psychology class my sophomore year and I was hooked. The funny thing is I don't do anything related to that class now, but that was the beginning. "
PainMatrix,"If you can do the GPA and research then the rest is just knowing what you want to do and tuning yourself to the right graduate program. The whole thing about graduate school is that you don't actually apply to the program, you apply to the professor and their lab. And that needs to be a good fit. The 5-10 out of 200-300 applications is not crazy but that's a lot of people with 2.0 gpa's and crappy GREs with no research experience. 

Master's degree cannot license you as a psychologist, maybe a therapist, I'm not sure. Is it a good backup option? That totally depends on what you want to do. I work for the VA and the starting salary for a psychologist is $90k which is really competitive. If you work in academia starting salary is probably closer to $60k. I hope I answered all of your questions, let me know if I didn't. "
PainMatrix,"I'm sorry, I don't know anything about it. "
PainMatrix,"I'm sure I'll have people that argue with me about this, but psychology is struggling with its past to become a science. A PhD means that you embrace that you are both a scientist and a practitioner and that one informs the other. It doesn't mean that you have to go into research at all, it just means that you're well versed in science and research and that this will inform your practice. "
PainMatrix,the thing is that you don't need money for the extra education if you can work hard as an undergrad. A PhD program should be fully funded by the program with an assistantship (usually around $20-25k)
PainMatrix,"Cool, I work for the VA currently and it's actually a great gig with awesome benefits. I work in primary care and it's pretty great with a lot of flexibility. ALL profs push for academia, that's what they are, it's not unusual and she should follow her heart. "
PainMatrix,"Maybe things have changed over the past 10 years, but as far as I'm aware a master's degree in psychology can still open you up to a number of clinical opportunities. Just a quick look online [shows there are some jobs](http://www.indeed.com/q-Masters-Psychology-jobs.html)"
PainMatrix,Thanks friend :)
PainMatrix,I am not sure how you were making that much as part of the military. Federal psychology jobs are pretty regulated in terms of payscale. 
PainMatrix,"Sports and health psych are 2 very different things. Most schools however require research experience so look for RA experiences where you can! Also, if you're getting a PhD it shouldn't cost you money, you should get tuition reimbursement and an assistantship. "
PainMatrix,Thanks buddy!
PainMatrix,"That is a therapist, but there's no actual legitimate definition of what that means. It can range from a self-proclaimed therapist to a clinical psychologist. "
PainMatrix,"I don't mean to be difficult but I don't know what you mean by ""therapist style."" If you mean orientation than the predominant one is cognitive-behavioral. If you want to do psychodynamic work (or quackery as I shall henceforth refer to it), then programs aren't difficult to find but jobs will be."
PainMatrix,"It's not me, it's the actual stats on fertility rates. It's a direct response to OPs statement. It's not political, judgmental, or delving any deeper than actual fertility rates. "
PainMatrix,"&gt;therapists or researchers

you're talking about two distinct though often overlapping things. The training and programs depend on what exactly you want to do."
PainMatrix,what are you looking for tips on?
PainMatrix,Nobody really cares about your grades as an RA. Bust your ass off in school while you can and ask your psychology professors for advice.
PainMatrix,"Psychologists do soooo many different things that it's impossible for me to say; you can work at a company helping them to improve efficiency, you could be doing assessments, you could be a researcher, you could be working with kids, adults, at a university, a private practice... there's tons of possibilities"
PainMatrix,"Totally agree, this was simply a comment on total fertility rates in response to OP, nothing further. "
PainMatrix,"Oh for sure, but OPs response was simply about having lots of babies."
PainMatrix,I would have to think you'd be torn though /u/dick-nipples. 
PainMatrix,"The field of psychology is growing moderately and I have to imagine prospects look good for developmental psychologists although I can't speak to that specifically. In terms of how long it took me to complete schooling, it was 4 years of coursework, 1 year of internship, and 1 year of post-doc before licensing and independent practice. "
PainMatrix,"I hope you'll understand that I don't want to say where I went. A reputable PhD program will fund you. I received an assistant-ship of $20,000/ year and full tuition reimbursement. My grades as an undergrad were so-so. I fucked around my first 3 semesters and had a 2.2. Then I figured out what I wanted to do and graduated with a 3.2."
PainMatrix,"I don't personally know anything about it, but according to the bureau of labor statistics [that field will be growing](http://www.psychologycareercenter.org/experimental-psychologist.html)"

PainMatrix,"&gt;tips for getting into grad school

Get research experience; even if you feel like you're eventually not going to be doing that it makes you look good and gives you a competitive edge. When you're applying to grad school it's useful to remember that you're applying to a lab and not the program as a whole, so figure out exactly what you want to do (e.g. substance abuse, health psych, anxiety, mood disorders, etc.) and reach out to the professors that run those department in advance asking relevant questions.

&gt;the average program

Not exactly sure what you mean by this question; you take your general courses, get involved with writing and research, start clinical work in your second year, and start teaching in your third year. It's demanding but it's also pretty exciting and stimulating.

&gt;clinical work

It can be draining so make sure you have a peer-support network available. Every setting is also different: private practice where you can pick your clients is very different from a community clinic which is very different from a hospital setting. Every day brings new surprises and challenges, but it's also immensely rewarding."
PainMatrix,"PhD in clinical psychology here. Depends what you want to do with it. There are many fields of psychology and many things you can choose to do (clinical work, assessment, research, teaching, or some combination) but in almost all cases you will need some graduate training. The pros if you go through to the end AND you get a job are that you'll be doing something you love and hopefully working to improve the lives of others. The cons are that jobs are scarce, competition is immense, and for that reason pay is not great. I make 100,000 and that's towards the mid-upper end of the scale for a clinical psychologist. 

Edit. I'll put in a plug for my sub that I decided to create 5 minutes ago, /r/behavioralmedicine. There's nothing there yet, but for those interested in behavioral medicine/health psychology my plan is to grow this thing."

PainMatrix,"Great question, /u/winters75. Fainting is regulated by a nerve coming from our brain-stem called the vagus nerve. Activation of this part of our brain-stem slows down our sympathetic nervous system (the gas-pedal in our bodies) and activates the parasympathic nervous system (our bodies braking system). So, essentially your blood pressure drops and your heart-rate slow down and some people faint. 

Now, to what activates this part of our brain-stem? This primitive part of our brains is activated by extreme emotions (e.g. acute stress). Some evolutionary psychologists hypothesize that fainting in response to your own blood may have been adaptive as it might slow down bleeding and reduce the likelihood of further attack (if your attacker thinks you're already dead and no longer a threat). Of course, these are just hypotheses and we'll never know exactly why this happens. What we do know is that it's not all that uncommon, fainting in response to blood occurs in anywhere from 3-4% of the population."

PainMatrix,"Adrenaline increases your heart rate, elevates your blood pressure and boosts energy supplies. Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, increases sugars (glucose) in the bloodstream, enhances your brain's use of glucose and increases the availability of substances that repair tissues.

Cortisol also curbs functions that would be nonessential or detrimental in a stressful situation. It alters immune system responses and suppresses the digestive system, the reproductive system and growth processes."

PainMatrix,"I assume many but maybe not all know this factoid relating Halloween and William Shatner:
&gt;The mask for Michael Myers was only described as having “the pale, neutral features of a man and for the movie the design was boiled down to two options—both were cheap latex masks painted white and bought for under $2 apiece at local toy stores by production designer Tommy Lee Wallace. One was a replica mask of a clown character called “Weary Willie” popularized by actor Emmett Kelly, and the other was a stretched out Captain Kirk mask from Star Trek. Carpenter chose the whitewashed Kirk mask because of its eerily blank stare that fit perfectly with the Myers character. "

I think there are some people who confuse satire for racism. I'm not saying that this is the case here, it may very well not be, but satire is about holding up negative stereotypes in a humorous way to show them for the awful thing they are. 

EDIT. I get it, people don't think satire is what was happening here, my point was meant to be general not specific to this shitty movie, but you can all go to hell, I'm going down with this ship.

PainMatrix,1935 was the year the [Nuremberg Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws) were enacted effectively making it impossible for Jews to keep their jobs. Just prior to the Olympics many gypsies and homeless were rounded up and placed into camps where they would eventually be killed.

PainMatrix,&gt;One of the most interesting proposals... the 'Body Back' involves an airtight sleeping bag that a human corpse is zipped into and then exposed to the freezing temperatures of outer space.

Kirk Douglas hoped to portray McMurphy himself, having starred in an earlier stage version, but was deemed too old for the part by his son Michael. Kirk relented, and the lead role went instead to Jack Nicholson, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Douglas won the Award for Best Picture for producing the film."

&gt;the answer may have something to do with the bandwidth of the frequency-tuned cochlear cells that detect sound in the inner ear. Two tones separated by larger than the bandwidth of a cochlear cell do not interfere in the ear at the site of transduction, whereas tones within the bandwidth do."

PainMatrix,"I agree with you on many levels but the difference with a heterosexual adult is that you have options. You could even hire a prostitute if you wanted to.

&gt;Is it also true that 'real' pedophiles are usually not incestuous? 

Yes. "
PainMatrix,There was a time and place where pederasty [was considered acceptable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece) just as there are times and places (still today) where homosexuality is considered and abomination. Much of this is culturally relativistic.

PainMatrix,"It's a good question, small trials have shown it to be effective although there are issues with compliance. "
PainMatrix,Sorry you're wrong. It employs the scientific method. 
PainMatrix,"No, from what we understand you're totally correct. Although there is considerable overlap not all child molesters are pedophiles. Many would prefer adults but may turn to children from a lack of adult sexual availability. "
PainMatrix,You're mixing up desire and behavior. Repress the behavior and rechannel the desire. 
PainMatrix,That's a really difficult question to answer. As long as they were normalizing the urge but not the behavior and were looking for ways to help each other cope I'd be in favor.

&gt;One night Mitch in the middle of his act says ""I have to go to the bathroom, can someone come on stage and tell jokes?"" Everyone thinks he's joking for a minute but then Mike who idolized him comes up and grabs the mic. ""I am pretty good at tennis, but I will never be as good as the wall. The wall is relentless… There was a jar of jelly beans at the state fair that said 'Guess how many and you win the jar,' I was like, 'C'mon man, lemme just have some.'"" Mitch comes back on stage and laughingly says ""aw man, you told my best jokes!""

PainMatrix,It's more difficult to calculate. You can either use DEXA scans or water or air displacement techniques but not every hospital is equipped with those things. A combination BMI and waist circumference is a pretty good estimate.

* 1 Tablespoon (one packet) of dry yeast
* 3 Tablespoons of warm water
* Liquid dish washing soap

* Small cup
* Safety goggles

&gt;I'm a model based in Los Angeles, and I have seen the casting sheets from my agents and for adults &amp; kids alike. When they are sorting for fat/ugly they always use the term ""real people"" at least once. For fat, they'll say ""preferably overweight"" or something so that they know the actor will be okay with being portrayed in that light. For ugly, they'll sometimes say ""unconventional, quirky, awkward"" etc.

&gt;TL;DR They specifically ask for fat/ugly and the kids often know it."

PainMatrix,"/u/cohan8999, as you’re aware we do not diagnose on this site, but I’d be happy to provide you with some additional context. First, as /u/totallyalive states, Bipolar can manifest in many combinations and degrees of depression and mania, but the important thing to note is that those symptoms last for **more** than just a couple of days. Second, your experience with being unemployed and its effect on your mood may not necessarily mirror your partners. It’s normal for anyone who is dealing with a life stressor to feel upset or down about it and it may even seem like it comes on quite suddenly. Since you just moved in together you are getting to see much more of your partner and in the process you will notice things that you weren’t aware of before. Moving in with a partner is a period of transition and adjustment for anyone.

Finally, I think it would be good to educate yourself on his condition, but even more importantly, talk to your partner. Let him know your own concerns, ask him questions about how he manages his condition, and find out ways in which you can be of help. Best of luck!"

PainMatrix,"The whole punishing the child for something they have no choice over is obviously bullshit, but these parents need to take a little more responsibility for getting their kid to school on time.

PainMatrix,"The working hypothesis Stanley Milgram had behind his experiments was that there was something fundamentally wrong or evil about the Nazis that made them do what they did. The experiments demonstrated that anybody could be made to do things that we would consider ""evil"" given the right circumstances.

PainMatrix,Suicide is nearly always about a moment of crisis and contrary to popular belief talking to someone who is feeling suicidal is not going to make it worse. If you or anyone you know is dealing with suicidal thoughts [here are some resources.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines). There's also a really compelling documentary specifically about suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge that I would encourage everyone to check out called [The Bridge](http://imdb.com/title/tt0799954/)
PainMatrix,"Although this is by no means my area of expertise either /u/smeeee, I also have some hypotheses. The phenomenon that you're talking about is typically referred to as ""repetitive thoughts"" of which rumination is a subcategory. The phenomenon of an ""earworm"" a catchy piece of music also seems to be related to this. We typically see higher degrees of this phenomenon in people who are prone towards running more anxious though certainly not exclusively. There doesn't seem to be much neuroscentific research on this, my own hypotheses are a combination of the following:
1. There is simply less distraction at night so our brains which are constantly craving stimulation begin to create their own.
2. During sleep certain parts of the brain go into resting states and when we wake our brains wake up in stages. The first part to wake up is the lower brain which is associated with movement and the last part to wake up is the prefrontal cortex, which is the seat of planning and inhibition. Therefore if you are in the midst of waking up, the brain is beginning to churn and fire synapses, but the parts that put on the brake (i.e. areas of the frontal cortex) are not yet working optimally. 

During these periods of time the neural circuits can also seemingly get stuck in a kind of playback loop. Since there are fewer external stimuli to pull them out and the higher order brain regions aren't being very helpful, this can go on for some time.

Anyway, hope this was helpful!"

PainMatrix,"Sure thing /u/smeeee, cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) of chronic pain involves providing patients with an increased sense of efficacy over their lives and symptoms by addressing and modifying pain-interfering cognitions, increasing activity and prosocial behaviors, and setting goals to improve mood and functioning. In CBT treatment for neuropathy, specific health behaviors that may be related to the cause of the neuropathy may also be addressed (e.g. diabetes, alcohol use). A very limited number of studies focusing on neuropathy and CBT have been conducted, [although they suggest at least short-term improvements in pain and physical functioning.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194148)
 

With that said I’d recommend it to you /u/throwaway_mst9000 (great reference by the way) as an additional treatment modality (not to be considered an alternative or fringe treatment). Ask your pcp for a referral to a psychologist or other MH professional that could work with you on these issues."

PainMatrix,"Absolutely, /u/smeeee. Well missholly, make that 2 psychiatrists and a psychologist. The connections we make with those in our lives are quite a wondrous thing. Given that you are a rarely emotive person who has been experiencing outbursts of emotion from a close family member that has just died makes you a human being, not an anomaly. I would ask you to consider these feelings as being okay and not to wonder if there is something wrong with you. You lost your mother. I don't know anything about the nature of your relationship with her, but I would imagine there is a void in your heart. 

Allow yourself to grieve this loss. Now, given that your mother committed suicide there may be additional questions you have. First off, know that suicide is never about someone else, your mother was in a dark place and it had nothing to do with you. Second, if you find yourself struggling in this regard I would highly recommend a counselor who specializes in grief. "

In healthy women, one [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819535/) suggests that menstrual phase doesn’t matter whereas two other studies from high quality journals suggests that [it](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590012005858) [does](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439591200680X).

PainMatrix,"This is my description from a few days ago:

&gt;I work with chronic pain patients and can tell you that pain is a multifactorial experience. It has to do with the severity and type of injury, the density and type of pain receptors, as well as social and psychological factors. For example, we know that focusing on pain leads to greater activity in pain processing centers (e.g. the somatosensory cortex) thereby increasing pain perception. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an evidence-based method of reducing pain processing and improving functioning in chronic pain patients. This intervention involves teaching patients physical relaxation and cognitive distraction techniques, reducing negative emotions, improving physical functioning, and a variety of other patient specific things (e.g. improving sleep, weight loss, smoking cessation). Chronic pain patients who complete this intervention in our program experience approximately a 20% reduction in their pain perception (on average) from beginning to end of treatment, which is fairly significant for someone living with chronic pain."
PainMatrix,"&gt;It is a very frightening scenario that police say is almost always the same – the victim just walking, when a car pulls up, and the man driving starts shooting.

PainMatrix,"My cousin Walter jerked off in public once. True story. He was on this plane to New Mexico when all of the sudden the hydraulics went. The plane starts spinning around, going out of control, so he figures it's all over and whips it out and starts beating it right there. So all the other passengers take a cue from him and they start whipping it out and beating like mad! So all the passengers are beating off, plummeting to their certain doom, when all of the sudden, the hydraulics kick back in. The plane rights itself and they land safely and everyone puts their penises or, whatever, you know, away and deboard. No one mentions the phenomenon to anyone else."
PainMatrix,"This was not published in any peer reviewed scientific journals. The study was funded by the Zoological Society of London a charity organization with close ties to the WWF (which itself has a history of making overblown claims).

PainMatrix,"I work with chronic pain patients and can tell you that pain is a multifactorial experience. It has to do with the severity and type of injury, the density and type of pain receptors, as well as social and psychological factors. For example, we know that focusing on pain leads to greater activity in pain processing centers (e.g. the somatosensory cortex) thereby increasing pain perception. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an evidence-based method of reducing pain processing and improving functioning in chronic pain patients. This intervention involves teaching patients physical relaxation and cognitive distraction techniques, reducing negative emotions, improving physical functioning, and a variety of other patient specific things (e.g. improving sleep, weight loss, smoking cessation). Chronic pain patients who complete this intervention in our program experience approximately a 20% reduction in their pain perception (on average) from beginning to end of treatment, which is fairly significant for someone living with chronic pain. 

So, to answer your question specifically, yes a person can modulate their experience of pain, and distraction techniques that reduce processing in the central nervous system would likely have the greatest impact."

&gt; I got your letter, my beloved; it has filled my heart with joy. I am grateful to you for the trouble you have taken to send me news; your health should be better to-day — I am sure you are cured. I urge your strongly to ride, which cannot fail to do your good. 

&gt;Ever since I left you, I have been sad. I am only happy when by your side. Ceaselessly I recall your kisses, your tears, your enchanting jealousy; and the charms of the incomparable Joséphine keep constantly alight a bright and burning flame in my heart and senses. When, free from every worry, from all business, shall I spend all my moments by your side, to have nothing to do but to love you, and to prove it to you? I shall send your horse, but I am hoping that you will soon be able to rejoin me. I thought I loved you some days ago; but, since I saw you, I feel that I love you even a thousand times more. Ever since I have known you, I worship you more every day; which proves who false is the maxim of La Bruyère that “Love comes all at once.” Everything in nature has a regular course, and different degrees of growth. 

&gt;Ah! pray let me see some of your faults; be less beautiful, less gracious, less tender, and, especially less kind; above all never be jealous, never weep; your tears madden me, fire my blood. Be sure that it is no longer possible for me to have a thought except for you, or an idea of which you shall not be the judge. 

&gt;Have a good rest. Haste to get well. Come and join me, so that, at least, before dying, we could say — “We were happy for so many days!!”

&gt;Millions of kisses, and even to Fortuné, in spite of his naughtiness.

PainMatrix,According to the video the magical age was naturally in a state of decline anyway. The rings were a way to extend that as the rings give the user what they want most and what the elves want most is magic. 
PainMatrix,Tl;dr the ring is an empty promise
PainMatrix,"tl;dw: The ""one ring"" was made by Sauron as a lens to focus his ability to rule others and decreases the power of the other rings. When lost, the ring wants to get back to Sauron and tries to trick its wearer in to doing so. The ring:
- tempts everyone with promises that it could be a mighty weapon to rule the world.
- makes you invisible, which seems great but makes you shine like a beacon so the wraiths can see you.
Hobbits make good ring bearers because they are reasonably satisfied with their lives and so are less tempted. When the one ring is destroyed this means that the elves magical rings will no longer work. It therefore signifies the end to the age of magic and the beginning of the age of men."

However, when asked whether they would “favor or oppose taking military action in Iraq to end Saddam Hussein’s rule even if it meant that U.S. forces might suffer thousands of casualties,” responses were dramatically different; only 43% said they favored military action while 48% said they opposed it. The introduction of U.S. casualties altered the context of the question and influenced whether people favored or opposed military action in Iraq.

&gt;An architect built this little gem in the early 2000s… his name was Andrei, so, he dedicated it to Holy Apostle Andrew the First-Called (Андрей Первозванный: Andrei Pervozvanny). The lake is 108 square kilometres (42 square miles) in area, with 18 square kilometres (7 square miles) being taken up by Olesny Island (it’s roughly 5 kilometres (3 miles) long by 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) wide). This little bit is one of the smaller islets, which take up 15 square kilometres (6 square miles) of area. So, the lake has 75 square kilometres (29 square miles) of water and 33 square kilometres (13 square miles) of islands within it."

PainMatrix,"&gt;very very loud indeed.

That is a huge understatement. The pain threshold for humans is 120-130 Decibels. Now consider if we were right next to it:

&gt;The Tunguska event was a massive explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya (Under Rock) Tunguska River in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai of Russia, at 7:40 AM on June 30, 1908. The explosion was most likely caused by the air burst of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitude of 5 to 10 kilometers (3–6 mi) above Earth’s surface. It was measured with the similar impact of a 1000-Mega-ton bomb **with a decibel rating 300-315. This is often considered to be the loudest single-event in history**"

*Your opponent: ""we may need to slightly decrease the education budget to make up for this deficit.""*

*You: ""No, taking away children's ability to learn is robbing the very future of America.""*

You've changed your opponents proposition but to an uninformed audience that isn't really listening it sounds like your opponent hates kids and doesn't want them to learn. You win. "

PainMatrix,"How did he feel after you divorced him? He probably didn't care, did he?"
PainMatrix,"First off, play nice and stop with the personal insults. It inhibits discussion rather then furthers it. BMI has its fair share of problems which is no secret. It's only one indicator, BUT for the majority of people a BMI of less then 18.5 is not healthy. "
PainMatrix,"It's not, but in OPs hypothetical scenario it would be. "
PainMatrix,"Yes, it would be if this were an advertising issue, which it's not. However it's a delicate conversation and an inconvenient truth for many people that when they are obese they are seriously increasing their disease risk. The tough part too is that their are far more people who are obese (35.7% of US population) than are underweight (1.6% US population) which promotes a normalization of it. "
PainMatrix,"Yes, that's the about the cutoff BMI for which a person could be diagnosed with anorexia according to the DSM. Having a BMI of less than that puts you at risk for a variety of health concerns. "

But the amounts of money that these governments are getting as a result of this—I mean, I just checked with the New York state comptroller. New York state alone, this year, is getting out of its bank settlements with Wall Street a windfall of $5 billion. That’s just New York state.

Good luck!"
PainMatrix,"I'm actually in the middle of writing a book on this very matter. The short answer is YES, the better you can be in being consistent in your sleep habits, the better you will be once he starts sleeping through the night. Good luck!"
PainMatrix,"I'd recommend two things: One is writing down any thoughts you have on a note-pad just prior to bed, a 5 minute worry log. Two, if that doesn't work consulting with a mental health professional that specializes in anxiety to help you work through these issues. Good luck."
PainMatrix,not sure how to answer your question. If you can't stay asleep either there is something waking you up (i.e. medical or mental health issues) or your body is ready to wake up and you are trying to overextend your sleep
PainMatrix,for... living life to its fullest?
PainMatrix,"Waking up several times per night is still in the realm of the normative. Honestly, the most important question to ask yourself is ""during the day am I generally feeling rested?"" If the answer is yes you're doing okay. There is a wide spectrum of what is considered normal and I think you're just fine. "

If you're not yanking my chain, you shouldn't be laying in bed for hours not sleeping, you should also maintain a consistent wake schedule. For your yelling and moving around I would recommend a sleep study and a consultation with a primary care provider. There may be a separate sleep disorder or a mental health condition that is underlying these issues."
PainMatrix,"It has to do with sleep efficiency. If you're spending less than 85% of your time in bed not sleeping your body is more likely to associate the bed and the bedroom with being awake and being aroused. So, if you're spending a lot of time in bed not sleeping you're more likely to develop a sleep issue."
PainMatrix,Your is massively accumulating sleep debt during the week then making up for those losses during your time off. Each time you sleep past that 4am wake-up time you're fucking over your circadian rhythm and throwing it off. The pattern you describe is a hallmark characteristic of the insomniac. I would highly recommend if you're seriously interested in improving your sleep that you try for 1 month to get up at the same time EVERY day and see what it does for you.
PainMatrix,"First off, you are not alone! I work with patients like you everyday who are able to break free of their anxieties and experience significant improvement in their sleep. Because of your pre-existing anxiety condition I'm not going to be able to help you with any behavioral suggestions that are going to offer significant relief. An evaluation by a psychiatrist is great, but I'd also recommend a psychologist to help permanently rid you of your panic sx's. Hold out the best you can and if you have safety concerns please immediately go to an emergency room. Here is also a number to a crisis line that you should take advantage of if you're struggling: 888-273-TALK."

PainMatrix,"If you're getting adequate sleep, you shouldn't need it. Caffeine is a stimulant and has one of the longest half lives of most drugs. If you have a cup of coffee at 4 PM about half of the caffeine contents are still in your system at 11 PM disrupting your sleep. That being said caffeine in moderation has a variety of positive benefits. Just don't drink it past early afternoon. "

&gt;The subject later reported that he could feel and hear the air leaking out, and his last conscious memory was of the water on his tongue beginning to boil.

PainMatrix,One of my last classes I was in college I was trying to get my grade from a 3.18 to a 3.20 so I could graduate with honors. I didn't do well on the final and printed out several graphs and an outline explaining how if I just could get a bump on the exam I'd be set. If I'd spent as much time on that writeup as I had on studying for the exam I would've been fine. 
PainMatrix,"Thanks buddy, this could easily be a still from the remake of the Neverending Story or Star Wars. "

Edit. To add to this, those areas as well as the armpits are particularly sensitive to androgens which is why we get more growth there. The very thin hair it replaces (called Vellus hair) disappears and the coarser hair (called Terminal hair) grows in. It's embedded much more deeply in the skin. "

PainMatrix,"This is **not** what's happening in the UK. Has anyone even actually read the [proposed legislation?](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukia/2014/321/pdfs/ukia_20140321_en.pdf) 

Essentially video-on-demand services and hard copy DVDs have different content standards. The legislation is all about ensuring that minors are not accessing certain types of content including things like non-consensual role-play, penetration with objects likely to do physical harm, and infliction of pain. I don't see this as being a bad thing. Here's the relevant excerpt from the proposed legislation:

&gt;Problem under consideration:Distribution of material that is R18 rated by the British Board of Film Classification (please see here for more information http://www.bbfc.co.uk/what-classification/r18) is restricted in 'hard-copy' such as DVDs by the Video Recordings Act 1984. UK VOD services are co-regulated by the Authority for Television On Demand (ATVOD) and Ofcom. The statutory framework protecting people from harmful material is unclear because it relies on a demonstration that it ‘might seriously impair’ those under 18, thereby providing scope for interpretation. There is also a regulatory inconsistency with hard-copy material. As VOD becomes more prevalent, the lack of clarity and inconsistency increases the risk of people under 18 being able to access R18 rated content. We think all such content should be behind access controls."

PainMatrix,"I would hardly classify karma-whores as ""greats,"" kind of pathetic really. "
PainMatrix,Exactly. The argument always goes that there's a lot of pressure on doctors to do something for these patients. I would argue that practicing medicine that not only isn't evidence-based but is functionally equivalent to a placebo while being damaging to the herd and the environment is downright unethical. The same reasoning seems to also apply to opiate medications in the majority of non-cancer chronic pain patients.

PainMatrix,I was allowing for the 14 minute drive from my place to her parents. 
PainMatrix,"I think he's hung up on the alot, as the wine glasses and bottle make the pun pretty obvious. "
PainMatrix,I'm merely pointing out the swift and dramatic juxtaposition from sweaty writhing cock-guzzling assplay to polite casual dinner conversation.  
PainMatrix,Don't forget to say something mildly clever. 
PainMatrix,It's always a little odd when my wife and I have just had sex and then we go out to meet her parents for dinner half an hour later. Do you know what your daughter and I have just done? I just had 3 fingers in her asshole while my tongue was probing the back of her cervix. Can you pass the rolls please?
PainMatrix,With the exception of July. 
PainMatrix,"&gt;""Vrban [the Commandant of the Camp] ordered all children to be separated from their mothers and put into one room. Ten of us were told to carry them there in blankets. The children crawled about the room, and one child put an arm and leg through the doorway, so that the door could not be closed. Vrban shouted: 'Push it!' When I did not do that, he banged the door and crushed the child's leg. Then he took the child by its whole-leg, and banged it on the wall until it was dead. After that we continued carrying the children in. When the room was full, Vrban brought poison gas and killed them all.""

I can understand how people are taught to dehumanize others during wartime but I can not on any level comprehend how one can torture and murder children. "
PainMatrix,I'm not touching this one......is not what Mrs. X said to Jack.

PainMatrix,"The fact that after 28 years the wound still aches this deeply for you is totally valid, I understand it. 28 years is also a really long time. Perhaps your family is at a point where they've come to peace with his loss and although they find the memory to be a sad one it no longer grips them. If so, maybe that's valid as well. "
PainMatrix,What happens when you bring him up to them?
PainMatrix,"Why won't your family acknowledge him?

Edit. Since it may be buried further down this thread here was my advice to OP:

PainMatrix,Well different strokes for different folks!
PainMatrix,"Ha ha, that's hilarious! :)"
PainMatrix,"Well, now you've got me thinking!"
PainMatrix,"I did this when I was younger. Not as satisfying, I lived in a poor area. The average tip was about .50 and people would count their pennies as they handed them over. "

PainMatrix,"Hey, nice followup, I'm impressed, and thanks!"
PainMatrix,Nobody would ever get angry with retail/customer service workers if they had been in their shoes. It would be a commercial utopia. 
PainMatrix,"I'm in a monogamous relationship with my former girlfriend who is currently my wife, and I've also had a vasectomy. There is no way I could ever go back to wearing condoms. "
PainMatrix,A hiking/camping trip somewhere. I hiked portions of the Appalachian trail with friends when I was in my 20s. These trips were some of the best experiences of my life. 
PainMatrix,"Fuck that, I love Heinz ketchup and wouldn't be mad to receive it as a gift. It's one of the few products where I won't buy the generic. "
PainMatrix,Damn that's a good prank. Harmless and everyone enjoyed a moment of much needed levity. 10/10
PainMatrix,And you started spanking it right then and there. 
PainMatrix,Cool! I wonder what else we have in common!
PainMatrix,There was a cool bit of trivia on an AR thread about movie mistakes which stated that there [were already bullet holes in the wall](http://i.imgur.com/DEIn5iu.jpg) prior to the shooting in that scene.

PainMatrix,"This is my go-to insomnia show, there is something hypnotic about watching the assembly of an accordion. "
PainMatrix,I thought the lawnmower man was a legitimately good movie. The sequel on the other hand...

PainMatrix,"Penn Jillette has a great take on this:

&gt;The question I get asked by religious people all the time is, without God, what’s to stop me from raping all I want? And my answer is: I do rape all I want. And the amount I want is zero. And I do murder all I want, and the amount I want is zero. The fact that these people think that if they didn’t have this person watching over them that they would go on killing, raping, rampaging is the most self-damning thing I can imagine."
PainMatrix,"At first glance I thought the authors name was Adrienne Hen, but I guess that was too much to hope for. "
PainMatrix,The Bridge. That documentary about people who commit suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. 
PainMatrix,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas captures it pretty well. 
PainMatrix,"My wife and I came up with this thing where when we're in an argument we pause and we each rate the importance of our side of the argument on a 1-10 scale.

That was the last time toilet paper was a point of contention. "
PainMatrix,Killed by relish... The age old story. 
PainMatrix,"No, I'm an adult. I only like the wheat side of my frosted mini wheats and that's final. "
PainMatrix,But my rhymes are copyrighted too. Do you just want me to PM you my public domain rhymes?
PainMatrix,And the woman in the middle is just displaying a countdown to sexual obsolescence.

PainMatrix,"Probably not, he wasn't even talking about it so it couldn't be crossfit. "
PainMatrix,"Testicular torsion. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. I'm lucky in that I didn't lose a ""close friend."""

PainMatrix,"Respectfully disagree. A big fan of the first one, but the second one just reeked of decay for me. "
PainMatrix,Road Warrior!
PainMatrix,It still amazes me how a series can go from so great to so bad with the third one. They should never have waited 16 years in between. 
PainMatrix,There was an excellent [NYtimes interactive published this week](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/08/world/does-torture-work-the-cias-claims-and-what-the-committee-found.html?_r=0) on the issue.

PainMatrix,Pretty much anytime I've pushed my body to an extreme. The first time I skied a double-black diamond comes to mind. 
PainMatrix,"I'm sure that this has been posted numerous times, but this young woman is truly amazing and if you haven't seen it, her interview on [Jon Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQtsdLB5MhQ) is remarkable."

PainMatrix,"I went to a wedding last summer where (unbeknownst to the guests) there was no bar, not even cash. Can attest that the reaction of people who are expecting alcohol and don't get it is not good. A number of the guests actually ended up taking out some of the cash from their gifts envelopes."
PainMatrix,"Just when they're talking about religion or at all? 84% of people in the world identify with a religion of some sort, that would mean discounting the majority of people you meet. "

PainMatrix,Looks like she got herself a douche as well.

PainMatrix,"Carbon nanotubes. I mean, holy shit, we're edging closer and closer to that [space elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator). 

&gt;A carbon nanotube is effectively a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon rolled into a cylinder. At a molecular level, the result looks like a roll of chicken wire and is the strongest material known to science. Six times lighter than steel and potentially hundreds of times stronger, the tubes also conduct heat more effectively than diamond and conduct electricity more effectively than copper."

PainMatrix,"That Democrats, Republicans, the major media organizations and the corporations that run them all benefit from creating divisive infighting among the populace on nonessential issues thereby perpetuating the system while accomplishing nothing but lining their own pockets.

PainMatrix,Here is the story on representative [Peter Kings comments](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-peter-king-on-obese-eric-garner-if-you-cant-breathe-you-cant-talk/) as mentioned.

PainMatrix,"Without a doubt. 

&gt;In 1996, Health Canada argued that emotional abuse is ""based on power and control"",[3] and defines emotional abuse as including rejecting, degrading, terrorizing, isolating, corrupting/exploiting and ""denying emotional responsiveness"" as characteristic of emotional abuse.

PainMatrix,"WWI was caused by a wrong turn!

&gt;The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was one of the biggest sparks to set off World War I.
&gt;Two assassination attempts happened on that fateful day. The first failed miserably because the duke’s chauffeur managed to deflect a bomb the assassins had thrown at their car. The resulting explosion wounded several bystanders and members of the duke’s entourage, but it left the duke and his wife unhurt. After escaping to safety, the duke insisted that he visit the victims of the bombing.
&gt;On the way to the hospital, the chauffeur made a wrong turn, leading them straight into one of the assassins. Gavrilo Princip had been laying low inside a cafe when he saw the oncoming car carrying the duke and duchess. From a distance of just a few feet, Princip fired off two shots as the car tried to reverse. The bullets hit their mark. The duke and duchess were dead, and all hell broke loose shortly afterwards."

PainMatrix,"
&gt;Every time this happens the black community acts as if there is some wild conspiracy against blacks by the crazy white christians.

The shitty thing is that it's not a conspiracy, but a reality that African Americans are more likely to commit violent crimes. Whether it's implicit or explicit, they're therefore also more likely to be profiled. I think most rational people understand that these statistics are mediated by socioeconomic status, but there it is. We've got a serious issue of poverty and violent crime in this country, but to focus on defending violent behavior as opposed to actually doing something to fix the problem is a complete distraction and ultimately detrimental to forward progress.

&gt;I've had mild depression/anxiety for a number of years and its been very bad the past few months, I'm sort of on the way out now though that I've stopped a few of the behaviours which were making it worse. I'm interested in seeing a therapist but I'm wondering a) if digging it up again when its been partially resolved might make it worse and b) what kind of help would be the best for hereditary (several people in my family) anxiety and depression, is that CBT or meds? Thanks :)

Hi :). So, a) digging something up will never make anything worse, in fact we know that avoidance is the most harmful thing to the psyche. b) guess what, all anxiety and depression disorders have a genetic component. CBT is still what we consider to be an efficacious therapy (basically it means we know that it works), as much as medications. I wouldn't recommend meds to you since you're out of the cycle, but remember depression is cyclical and will likely return so you'd likely benefit from treatment. "
PainMatrix,Vomit. I tried to clean it up by vacuuming it in my 17 year old drunken stupor. Worst mistake I made. That smell permeated the household vacuum.

PainMatrix,"cooking! It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive either. Right now I have a crockpot going that took me 2 minutes to set up; I threw some chuck meat, a bag of frozen veggies (corn, green beans, and carrots) and a spice packet in there. I'm going to boil up some pasta, mix it all together and now I have like 4-5 meals for under $10!"
PainMatrix,Sewing. If I'd learned this earlier I would've saved a ton on clothing that I ended up getting rid of.
PainMatrix,"That's because the show ended literally 20 years ago when Bob Ross died. Most people have never seen it but the reference has become self-referential.

PainMatrix,"I very much doubt you would feel anything. Pretty sure that's instant death. I'll look into it and be back. 
EDIT. Okay, I'm back with some quick calculations:
Wrecking balls range from about 1,000 pounds (450 kg) to around 12,000 pounds (5,400 kg). Let’s say conservatively that the ball is moving at 10m/s. So, on the low end a 450 kg mass moving at 10 m/s will be (1/2)(450 kg)(10 m/s)^2 or 22,500 Joules. This is more than a .50 caliber bullet hitting you, and this thing is smashing your entire body. I think we can safely say this would be instant death. "

Psychologist here. Many people think that surrounding themselves with the right things, the right people, or getting the right job will lead to happiness. And they will, very temporarily. But research suggests that the only long term predictors of self-happiness are *doing* good things for others. This doesn't have to mean volunteer work, it can be something as simple as helping out a coworker or friend, or doing something nice for a stranger.

About 14% of Muslims in the nations surveyed (and 8% of Muslims in the US) said violence against civilians is ""often"" or ""sometimes"" justified. 26% of Muslims in Bangladesh believe attacks are either somewhat justified or often justified, 18% in Malaysia, 7% in Iraq, 15% in Jordan, 29% in Egypt, 39% in Afghanistan and 40% in the Palestinian territories. [30][31][32] The survey did not include some Muslim nations, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Yemen, Syria, and Libya, but did include densely populated Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria and Indonesia.[33]

EDIT. It seems I may have erred in this. /u/iamfearless just sent me a Gallup poll from 2011 that states that Muslims as a group are among the least likely to condone the killing of civilians.

3. Does the consumer have to buy something to enter the contest? (This is called ""consideration"" by the FCC.)

PainMatrix,ELTTIKS ELTTIKS ELTTIKS!
PainMatrix,"&gt;In the early 1860s the Matterhorn was ""the last great problem of the Alps."" Most experienced climbers doubted that it ever would be climbed. Superstitious natives believed there was a ruined city on the summit inhabited by demons and spirits of the damned.

&gt;It was finally successfully scaled in 1865 by the Englishman Edward Whymper and six others. The triumph was marred by the most famous mountaineering tragedy of all time--a tragedy that nearly put a halt to the sport. On the descent, the second man on the rope slipped, knocking the first man over; the third and fourth were dragged violently along. The rope broke and the four men were hurled down, falling from precipice to precipice, to the Matterhorn Glacier, almost 4,000 ft. below. Immediately after the accident, the three survivors saw an illusion of three crosses in the clouds, which, they reasoned later, must actually have been a fogbow.

&gt;Eventually the furor over the accident died down, and in the years since, the Matterhorn has been climbed from every possible angle by over 60,000 people, including women, children, octogenarians, blind men, and a mountaineer who later became Pope Pius XI."

PainMatrix,How's the account going so far?

PainMatrix,"Ironic in a way, meaningless in the larger sense. "
PainMatrix,"I was thinking something like ""Hand in my pocket"" by Alanis Morisette, but yours is good too. "
PainMatrix,I like that thought. 
PainMatrix,"And I'd say something along the lines of ""why don't we both pick-at-**this**-pocket"" and we'd high five and jump up in the air freeze frame. "

PainMatrix,"I'm a clinical psychologist, something I've wanted to do ever since high school. "
PainMatrix,"Dr. Pachyderm, MD. I assume you'd have to be an otolaryngologist, probably a big need for that specialty among elephants. "
PainMatrix,"I don't disagree with your statement entirely but I don't think you read what I said closely. Being good *doesn't mean* that good things will happen. It doesn't mean they might not, but there are no guarantees for any one of our actions or for the eventual outcome. A person could spend their entire lives in the service of human kind and end up alone in a paupers grave. "
PainMatrix,I don't think that most people need the threat of consequence to act with decency. 
PainMatrix,It can motivate a lot of desperate people. 
PainMatrix,"Being good doesn't mean good things will happen. Conversely, being bad doesn't mean that bad things will happen to you. There is no universal justice and no karma. "
PainMatrix,"For my ASL friends.

PainMatrix,TL;DR Dying rich man man mourns sled
PainMatrix,"off the top of my head:

- last day of school (pretty much any one of them in elementary school)
- first time a girl said I love you to me.
- first time I got stoned and stayed out all night with friends looking at the stars
- the day I met my wife
- landing my dream job 
- the day my kid was born

I'm sure I could think of more, but looking back its been a pretty good ride so far. Thanks for the memories OP. "
PainMatrix,"The question referred to rationing your cell-phones charge during a power outage (ie not using it). So, to use your landline it needs to be plugged directly into the wall. "
PainMatrix,"Time is the worst place, so to speak..."
PainMatrix,Anywhere north of the DMZ. 
PainMatrix,There is a great deal of comorbidity between  the two and some reasonable speculation that they're on the same dimension. 
PainMatrix,Imagine a reddit with no OP. A true utopia. 
PainMatrix,I've been using Fastlane/ EZ-pass for about 10 years now. You just attach this device to your windshield and it's read by the sensors as I get to drive through the tolls at a minimum of 15mph. 
PainMatrix,"That's if you have a landline **and** a non-cordless phone. I can only think of my grandmother fitting that bill, and she's dead. "
PainMatrix,Or having to show up to vote. Why can't we do this online yet? Yes I understand that some of the privacy concerns but these are equally as pervasive when voting in person.

PainMatrix,"And yet people continue to drink the ""blood of Christ"" in church. "
PainMatrix,"Caring about money. 

This was never that important to me before. Living paycheck to paycheck was just fine for me, but as soon as I saw the positive test this changed. I got an extra job, I worked more hours, etc. If I had to eat ramen noodles for every meal during a week where I was cash-strapped isn't a big deal for me, but there is no way I wanted anything resembling insecurity for this baby. "
PainMatrix,Creationists frequently bring up the argument that there is no way that evolution is real because the eye just seems too complex and therefore God must have made it. It's a totally specious and emotional argument. 
PainMatrix,"Damn, I hope that's not true!"
PainMatrix,"I agree totally, I was just being sardonic. "
PainMatrix,"Correct, I'm mentioning it because it's the closest thing we have on that spectrum.

PainMatrix,"I like your response and will definitely use it, thanks!"
PainMatrix,Not all spices. My point is specifically that people tend to add more hot spices to oysters which have the effect of numbing your taste buds.

PainMatrix,Well if your fancy natural evolution theory is real then explain the complexity of the eyeball to me Mr. Smarty-pants!

PainMatrix,"The lyrics to the entire song ""what Sarah said"" by Death Cab For Cutie. I've spent a bit of time in hospitals with friends and family members on life support and these lines cut deep:

And it came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to Father Time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU that reeked of piss and 409
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself that I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD took you a little farther away from me
Away from me

Amongst the vending machines and year-old magazines in a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend on a faulty camera in our minds
But I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground as the TV entertained itself

'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes round and everyone will lift their heads
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said that ""Love is watching someone die""

So who's going to watch you die?..

First of all, get help immediately. Call 911. 

While waiting, if there is no immediate threat, the best way to ""talk"" to someone who is feeling suicidal is to listen **without judgment**, to their experience.

&gt;What kinds of variables should I look at to get on a restful schedule? Are there ""opposite"" sleep disorders where one always feels slightly sleepy or at least could fall asleep at any time? Thanks! 

You're potentially on the right track with sleep disorders or other medical markers. I think I brought up hypersomnia to somebody else on this thread but what I would suspect is that the quality of the sleep that you're getting is not adequate. There are a variety of conditions from sleep apnea to narcolepsy that can affect this. You should speak to your primary care doctor about these concerns. 

Good luck"
PainMatrix,"
&gt;How detrimental is it to interrupt just on the weekends? Say I do 6 AM consistently during the week then come the weekend I sleep til 10? I don't want to wake up at 6 on the weekends but I need to wake up at 6 during the week 

For most people it's not too much of a problem at all. However you are accruing a sleep debt throughout the week as indicated by your need to catch up to it. So one thing to be aware of is as the week goes on your ability to focus is going to be affected as are some health markers, such as inflammation. "
PainMatrix,"
&gt;Does reading count as stimulating? 

It's actually subjective. Do you feel stimulated while doing it or does it make you feel drowsy? Some people can tolerate reading while others can't. 

In regards to you having difficulty falling asleep I would recommend 2 things. Learn a relaxation technique (eg diaphragmatic breathing, visual imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation) and also take 5 minutes to write down your worries and stressors a little while before bed. Putting them down on paper can get them out of your head.

Good luck.

PainMatrix,"If you're asking if you should be concerned about the melatonin, then the answer is no, not really.

Actually it's just as effective as some of the harder hitting sleep medications for most. "
PainMatrix,It is atypical although we sometimes see this with use of drugs or alcohol including nicotine. Typically deep stage sleep is more prevalent early in the night and light sleep and REM sleep are more prevalent later in the night.
PainMatrix,Any room for a love-seat or a couple of chairs in your room. Even just being out of the bed if not out of the room can help. 
PainMatrix,"There's the possibility you may have a circadian rhythm disorder where the timing of sleep is affected. There are a number of treatments for this which you can see below. However, I urge you to first get evaluated by a physician or specialist. Good luck.

PainMatrix,"
&gt;Is it possible to ""catch up"" on sleep. Like not getting enough during the week, so you'd sleep more on the weekend? 

To some extent yes. It helps you feel recovered, lowers stress levels to baseline, and reduces inflammation. However, it doesn't seem to help bring concentration levels back to normal. Only regular consistent sleep can do this. 

&gt;Also, its not unusual for me to sleep 12 hrs straight. Is this my body telling me I dont sleep enough or is it something deeper?

There is a continuum of people on the one end like you who can pretty much do anything with no sleep consequences to the other end in which pretty much anything can disrupt sleep. It's characterized by differences in neuroanatomy and I hope you're able to sustain it. By the way, 21 drinks per week is high; over-time if you keep it up, this is undoubtedly going to lead to some serious physical and behavioral problems. NIH recommended limits for males are 14 drinks per week and no more than 4 drinks in a given session. Let me know if you have any other questions."

PainMatrix,"
&gt;I would like to ask if it is worth the effort to force myself to awaken at 7:00 every day? 

In your case yes, absolutely, 100%. There's no trick to this. It's quite grounded in neuroscience that if you have a consistent wake up time it significantly improves your circadian rhythm. This is far and above my #1 recommendation and those guidelines have been shown to give improvement even in people with circadian rhythm disorders. 

"
PainMatrix,"I'm happy to try to help somebody struggling with this

&gt;Are there any actual problems with being a night person? Is it unhealthy in any way?

Nothing too significant we don't think. Night owls tend to have more bad health habits like smoking and drinking, but that's a correlation and likely related to both an underlying neural mechanism coupled with greater exposure to an environment where drugs, drinking, and smoking are likely to happen (i.e. night-time)
Actually there also do seem to be some positive benefits to being a night owl. at least one study relates it to greater productivity.
 

&gt;Does abusing REM cycles to try and obtain more restful sleep actually work? If yes, does sleeping for periods of time multiplied by 1.5 hours usually do it?

you're probably referring to any number of gadgets and apps that purport to help you wake up between sleep-cycles. There's no great research on these. In part, my personal belief is that such a great focus on your sleep is actually stimulating, making it more difficult to get good quality sleep. The other thing is that it really doesn't seem to matter all that much where in our sleep cycle we wake up. Researchers at Harvard show that regardless of what stage sleep patients were woken from, there was no difference on cognitive performance. 
 
&gt;Is it actually possible to train your body to require less sleep?

No, you may fool yourself into thinking this, but objective measures of things like response-time show that you can not.
 
&gt;Are programs like [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) actually helpful
to maintaining a better sleep schedule? The discoloration kind of annoyed me, so I never gave it a fair chance.

I've never heard of this, but just quickly glanced at it. Light interferes with sleep because it inhibits melatonin production. This is particularly true for blue wavelengths and less true for red wavelengths. This applies to light from any source, including a computer. I highly recommend you get off the computer and avoid bright lights for at least 1 hour before bed to give your brain a chance to start building melatonin and a chance to unwind for the day.
 
&gt;Would you or any of your colleagues be interested in doing an AMA? I'm sure a lot of Reddit could use it.

 "
PainMatrix,"
&gt;How should we adjust on weekends? For example, partying and staying up until 2-3. Do we get up at the same time regardless? Should we sleep-in?

Depends on how much of an issue you're having with fatigue. If it's not serious, party-on, sleep-in. However, alcohol + inconsistent sleep schedule = not going to work out if you are having problems with daytime fatigue. "
PainMatrix,"
&gt;What do you think about people that work rotating shifts?

Your schedule definitely sucks but could be worse. If you really want to improve your sleep then your sleep schedule should be any 7 hour window between 1430 and 2330. Your circadian rhythm will generally stay organized and you'll have improved consistency. Maintain good sleep hygiene habits outside of that window, avoid light (eg room-darkening shades) and expose yourself to bright lights during your working night hours. "
PainMatrix,"Sorry, I'd rather not get too specific. "
PainMatrix,"Agreed, that's partly why I got into this field :)"
PainMatrix,First job interview is a big deal. It's all relative. 
PainMatrix,"
&gt;doesn't the circadian schedule depend on sunlight?

Yes and no. Exposure to any light (not just sun) inhibits melatonin production in the brain, which helps to wake us up. I would recommend a sunrise alarm clock for use in the winter to help with this."

PainMatrix,If you're feeling generally rested I wouldn't worry about it. These guidelines are for people with insomnia. 
PainMatrix,Your brain starts going into stage 3 sleep (the deepest sleep) at around 30 minutes and when you wake during that you'll feel really groggy and it will interfere with your nighttime sleep. Shorten your nap to 20 minutes or avoid napping altogether. 
PainMatrix,About 15 minutes is the average for people without a sleep disorder. 
PainMatrix,Good luck!
PainMatrix,Sex is important and shown to be actually helpful with sleep as well!
PainMatrix,"That's going to be a problem, because your sleep cycle is controlled by an area of your brain called the SCN which works by establishing a consistent pattern.

The more of the rules you can follow below, the better you'll do:

1. Only go to bed when sleepy. Bear in mind being sleepy is not the same thing as being tired. It is important to be aware of this difference. Sleepiness is signaled by behavioral signs such as dropping eyelids, involuntary head nodding and yawning. This rule helps prevent lying in bed engaging in negative sleep thoughts. 

2. If after about 20 minutes you are unable to fall asleep or awaken and find it difficult to fall back asleep, leave the bed and go to another room and engage in a relaxing activity such as some light reading or using a relaxation technique until you do feel drowsy. Then return to bed and repeat as often as necessary until you do fall asleep. It is important to not watch the clock while doing this. It is your subjective estimate of time that is important. It is also important to not engage in stimulating activities during this time.

3. Use the bed only for sleep and sexual activity. Do not engage in sleep-incompatible activity in bed such as eating snacks, watching TV, etc. These activities obviously will result in arousal and make it difficult to fall asleep. Repeatedly engaging in these kinds of activities helps condition arousal to the bed environment when instead you want to condition a feeling of relaxation to being in bed.

4. Keep a regular morning rise time no matter how much sleep you got the night before. This will help regularize the circadian (24 hour) schedule and if you don't sleep well one night, the drive to sleep will be higher the following night - if you don't dissipate it with low quality, light morning sleep by staying in bed later than planned.

5. Avoid naps of more than 30 minutes. This prevents reducing sleep drive earlier in the day that can make it harder to fall asleep at night."

It will take an average of 2 weeks and then the rest should fall into place (also make sure you don't ignore your body when it's telling you it's time for bed).

There are lots of other little things, but that's the big one. "

PainMatrix,"I think I may literally be getting too old for this shit. Oh, that's a giant fucking mushroom. "
PainMatrix,I'm not sure there's a good solution to this. Maybe personal preference but when I open a meme is prefer to not see anything else. Actually the least intrusive thing would maybe be to do it translucent so that it's there but barely noticeable. 
PainMatrix,"Hey dev! It's **under** the meme on my alien blue app, I was just exaggerating for comedic effect. I haven't seen these before today and didn't realize it was a link. I do have to say that I find it a bit visually distracting anyway. "

PainMatrix,I wasn't defending the Meme. Whether it's funny or not is up to interpretation. What's got you so riled up any way?
PainMatrix,"""At least get the lyrics right""

PainMatrix,Awesome. 
PainMatrix,Exactly!
PainMatrix,You're the one that accused me! Apparently you're also kind of a jerk huh?
PainMatrix,"Jesus, I have no extra accounts. One of the initial commenters posted the same comment twice, so I thought it would be amusing to copy their comment and also post it twice as a joke. After that I made my real comment which you can see above. What is this, the Spanish inquisition??"
PainMatrix,You speak the truth! Several years ago I ordered a couple hundred dollars worth of old school Super NES games and forgot about it. A couple days later when they arrived and I remembered what I'd done I also was reminded of the fact that I had given my NES to my cousin a couple of years earlier. Amazon should seriously have a disabled-while-drinking mode.

PainMatrix,That's fucking Yo La Tengo backing her! 
PainMatrix,I hope that's not a frequent occurrence for you! I know what you mean though. 
PainMatrix,Of course. Medical staff need some way to get hands-on training. The point though is that teaching hospitals with good supervision don't seem to have this problem. I can't seem to find rankings of worst teaching hospitals after a quick look.

PainMatrix,As close to the feeling as I could find. 
PainMatrix,I do? How is that specifically?
PainMatrix,Everything you said I agree with and you hit the nail on the head with the 2nd paragraph. 
PainMatrix,"Well used meme then. Please don't call me a dick, it's rude. "
PainMatrix,"It's not bad. It's what expected, I didn't do a good job of communicating the highly over zealous manner in which this couple immediately acted as if we had a well-established friendship. "
PainMatrix,"I think I am, and I was cordial to them. I just felt a bit uncomfortable. "
PainMatrix,"No, it was a couple of hours, but it was within 30 minutes that the other couple started planning our summer together. "
PainMatrix,I can see there's no point in having a reasonable discussion with you. 
PainMatrix,"Other people said that, I just said I was uncomfortable and felt they were too forward for me. "
PainMatrix,"*Impolite would be rejecting a fellow human's friendliness whilst watching each other's offspring forming a friendship. Just my opinion.*
I didn't reject their friendliness, I did reject the idea that we all immediately needed to go camping, join a club together, and make plans without the kids. 

*Or maybe you don't know them and rendered them desperate.*
I didn't say they were desperate, I said I was uncomfortable. 

*it reeks of being anti-social and selfish.*
I'm quite social and have many friends, and I don't think it's selfish that I don't want to immediately fill my calendar with tons of plans based on a single meeting. "
PainMatrix,I think you should read through my replies before judging me. 
PainMatrix,"I disagree. I think there's been interesting discussion on multiple sides of this issue. Sure, some people are being judgmental or impolite, but I think you'll find that anywhere. "
PainMatrix,"Well I'm not. I enjoy meeting people, making friends, and doing things. It's not easy making friends, but I also feel it can't be forced. "
PainMatrix,"Thank you. It **is** about chemistry. There wasn't that immediate click for me, which made it feel very forward. "
PainMatrix,"Thanks, you expressed exactly how I felt, apparently better than I have been doing judging by the hate I'm getting on this thread. "
PainMatrix,"That's a bit presumptuous. 

EDIT. this comment is getting downvoted after the other poster deleted their comment. People are downvoting it and are not even aware of the context!"
PainMatrix,"If I scared you off then I'm not communicating myself correctly. We hang out with other parents frequently, and of all of those parents these were the first who we felt weird about. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea. "
PainMatrix,But you said I was rude which implies that I was offensive towards them. How is that?
PainMatrix,"I don't think I said anything about being offended, but because of their insistence I had a hard time looking for a polite way to decline. I'm not saying that as whoa is me kind of thing at all, that's just how it was. 
EDIT woe"
PainMatrix,Because it was too much too soon. It was socially weird. 
PainMatrix,This was in no way intended to be a humble-brag. I just think that you can't force a friendship in the first 30 minutes of meeting someone. 
PainMatrix,I have no problem being friendly and making friends. I just felt this particular couple was overly aggressive in trying to force it. 
PainMatrix,That's pretty presumptuous of you. 
PainMatrix,"I feel differently, but in what way do you think I was rude?"
PainMatrix,Thanks for saying that. I'm all about making friends and being social but I felt very awkward with how quickly forward they were. 
PainMatrix,"Yikes. I am social, it was just way forward and too fast. "
PainMatrix,"Finally, some sage advice that I can immediately put into practice. Thanks friend!"
PainMatrix,"They weren't **that** bad, just very insistent. And with little ones it's hard enough to make time to get to see existing friends and family. "
PainMatrix,We all have our crosses to bear!
PainMatrix,"I don't know, there's something more genuine and therefore less awkward for me about just saying, hey it was good seeing you and moving on. "
PainMatrix,"Did I by chance sell them to you? Oh wait, I never sold any. "
PainMatrix,Didn't know that thanks!

PainMatrix,"His comments just seem so specific and negative, but not wildly over the top. If he is a troll, my opinion is he's not very good at it. "

PainMatrix,"Wow, that's amazing, I've never seen that picture before. Thanks for sharing it. "
PainMatrix,Nice contribution. 
PainMatrix,"Although that was entirely unnecessary, I thank you very much. "
PainMatrix,"Well, thanks then!"
PainMatrix,"No, he was hauled off. "
PainMatrix,There are many people who still haven't seen this picture as you can see from the comments. Why the anger?
PainMatrix,"Former governor Jessie Ventura, is that you?"
PainMatrix,"I think it's important to commemorate this date and this is one of the most inspiring images I know. Anyway, I see by your history, you're not exactly OC material either. "
PainMatrix,It must be under heavy load. It was working fine a little while ago. 
PainMatrix,Sarcasm?
PainMatrix,"Agreed. If there were a similar photo of her, it would be equally as poignant. "
PainMatrix,"Another user posted the image of the larger perspective below but here it is again.
http://i.imgur.com/s0wPw06.jpg"
PainMatrix,"I don't claim to know much about Chinese history. For me this picture could've been taken anywhere in the world. But I see a man who looks so very small, standing in front of a group of machines capable of killing him in an instant. I see that man and I think to myself that man believes in something so powerful and so much bigger than him that he's willing to sacrifice his own life for it. That thought sends goosebumps throughout my body and makes me hope that I would take a similar stand for my convictions. "
PainMatrix,We'll likely never know his intentions. But the picture has been adopted to become a symbol of defiance by others. I stand by the title. 
PainMatrix,"I don't think any reasonable person would argue that the history of their country, including the US is unblemished. I think the point of this photo is that people need to stand up against the atrocities or inadequacies of their governments. "
PainMatrix,"It was this picture? Wow, in a way that makes **me** like a modern day tank-man! "
PainMatrix,"""1833 – U.S. President Andrew Jackson becomes the first President to ride on a train.""

PainMatrix,"1) That's doesn't sound remotely stonery
2) You're a plagiarist.

PainMatrix,The second part of her plan was to sow linguistical confusion around that word for years to come
PainMatrix,Handler to the right is not amused by your antics OP!
PainMatrix,"Ha ha, agreed. Goes to show you the power that the vagina holds that shame needed to be attached to it. I think we've made some progress since those olden times. "
PainMatrix,The fact that they had to make a sign for this means that at least one person did this. Boggles my mind. 
PainMatrix,Exactly. I thought this was pretty cut and dry. 
PainMatrix,You're not crazy! I took down my original post because a couple of people thought I was referring to area codes. I put this up to make it more clear. 
PainMatrix,"Didn't know that, thanks!"
PainMatrix,"Right, but not if someone just casually asks you for the time. "
PainMatrix,"You say ""nine zero five""? You're a monster. "

PainMatrix,C.O.P.
PainMatrix,Exactly. It's an important step. 
PainMatrix,"I don't think so. You have to have 2 years of ssdi before you can get Medicare. The requirements for that are:

- you cannot do work that you did before;
- we decide that you cannot adjust other work because of your medical condition(s); and
- your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death"

PainMatrix,"Well, as long as we're all annoyed I guess this is just reddit status quo. "
PainMatrix,I'm annoyed that you're getting downvoted. The comment you replied to stated that OP had 4 children (which he doesn't) and then the commenter edited themselves to remove that part. 
PainMatrix,I care about the angle and the editorializing. They decided to include an op-ed asking whether the world is ready for the kiss. That totally detracts from the real story. I don't know what else to tell you. 
PainMatrix,"Thanks for volunteering that. There's been a lot of debate in this thread, but sometimes a personal anecdote is needed. "
PainMatrix,True. She will definitely give you the most unbiased opinion!
PainMatrix,Still okay to make that choice. Just know what you're potentially getting yourself into. 
PainMatrix,But when that void comes around **you** may be the first one they go to. 
PainMatrix,Gotcha. Well happy Mother's Day then!

PainMatrix,"There was a TED conversation on this. This was the top answer from a professional singer: 
*1) Partly because we all want success in the US.2) Partly because a song written in the US has rhymes that only work with a US accent. 3) Partly because there is a generic international accent that sings the vowel sounds with a tone that is easiest to sing and this approximates a sort of generic US accent, although it sounds quite Australian if you don't pronounce the R's on the ends of words.*

PainMatrix,"*it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you can win a hundred battles without a single loss.* -Sun Tzu"
PainMatrix,"I think the major problem with this is that kids are developing schema based on what they hear and see.

PainMatrix,"I've taken the vocal position since my friends  started having babies, that I don't think newborns are cute. They're not, they're gangly, bald, and shrivelly; I think they look like aliens until about 6 months. After that if I don't think a baby is cute I just don't say anything at all. "

PainMatrix,"This is a good illustration of how the media influences how we think about a particular story in subtle ways.

PainMatrix,"I know we all **know** which part is the sweet spot right guys, but which part is it again?"
PainMatrix,"So in other words, everything is priced?"

PainMatrix,I srsly wonder if texting &amp; emailing r somehow to blame. 
PainMatrix,Did you scoff when the flyer listed bands you'd inadvertently heard on the radio OP?
PainMatrix,Maybe we come full circle and bring Craig Kilborn in to do his show!
PainMatrix,"Right, and I disagree. OP is saying that one stereotype is considered to be okay while the other isn't. What I'm saying is that most people hate stereotyping either gender."
PainMatrix,"Although the action on that was sweet, this was the big one:

PainMatrix,"As much as I love Stephen Colbert, I'm a little perplexed about this decision. He'll have to go from playing a persona to being a genuine interviewer and host. I'm curious about how that will play out. "
PainMatrix,"I'm the exact opposite, I actually thought most people were. "
PainMatrix,"Well, fuck me then. I'll just see myself out. "
PainMatrix,"Exactly. OP either has some shortcomings or low self-esteem, but either way that is going to turn itself into a self-fulfilling prophecy sooner or later. She's with you for a reason OP, remember that. "
PainMatrix,"My parents had a TV guide subscription. I'm amazed looking back how much time I invested looking through it at everything that was on that week, and then actually waiting around for the show to start, and then sitting through commercials. Having a DVR has probably cut down the amount of time I invest in TV by half. "
PainMatrix,I have this same complaint about reddits AMA's. 
PainMatrix,"I also do this, then sadly I am proud of myself for thinking I've performed a public service. "
PainMatrix,"Ah, the fanciful gaiety of a more naive age. "
PainMatrix,"I wonder how old you are OP? I came of age to early 90s grunge and Nirvana. Prior to that  the radio airwaves were dominated by nicely manicured and poppy sounding artists like Michael Bolton, Wilson Phillips, and En Vogue. To hear this abrasive and loud band on the radio felt like someone was putting a soundtrack to me hitting puberty. It was dirty, grungy, and unapologetically so. The emotional connection that I will always have to that music is truly singular. "
PainMatrix,"I disagree with you OP. If a man or a woman chooses amongst themselves to do particular chores I don't think anyone gives a shit. But, as soon as you start saying its a mans or a woman's job to do any particular chore, I think that rubs people the wrong way regardless of which gender you're talking about. "
PainMatrix,Thank you! That was very insightful!
PainMatrix,"You must drive an automatic. It does work with a manual. In response to the latter part of your statement, I **want** the firefighters to do as little extra work as possible. I'm attempting to figure out what that entails. "
PainMatrix,"Okay, but if they're breaking the windows anyway wouldn't it be easier for them to just break the drivers side window, put the car in neutral, and roll it out of the way? I guess I just want to know they're intentionally fucking this asshole over. 
EDIT. Fuck whoever is downvoting me, I'm just trying to understand how this works. /u/yourfavoritebandsux gave a cogent response to this. 
EDIT 2. Since I'm getting downvoted to hell for some reason, fuck you all, fuck every last one of you.

PainMatrix,"Any firefighters here? Couldn't they just as easily have put the hose over the car? Not that I have any sympathy for that driver, fuck them. "

PainMatrix,Minus the diabetes you and your dad appear to have the same type of relationship I want with my son when he gets older. I can't wait to tell that little shit to go fuck himself. 
PainMatrix,The 6-pack abs are personally a turn off for me. To each their own!
PainMatrix,"Wow, saw you deleted this and just looked through some of your history. You've got this reddit thing pretty locked down. "
PainMatrix,"Fuck these people. Let's force them to walk around on their hands and everytime they stumble or fall we'll kick them in the stomach.
EDIT. read the fucking article before you downvote me asshole"
PainMatrix,Socks are worse. I honestly can't tell the difference between my wife's socks and my toddler daughters socks. They're all tiny. 
PainMatrix,"I get what you're saying, but because they're public employees, teachers actually have to follow guidelines about excepting gifts from students. They can get in a lot of trouble if they don't. "
PainMatrix,"Ah, well in that case thanks for being the one person in this thread that gets it!"
PainMatrix,"Okay, that's pretty good, but she has still retained a softness to her. "
PainMatrix,Plus live in the now or update your stickers once in a while. There are at least 5 Bush stickers on there. 
PainMatrix,"Take a look at that individuals other posts. Also, I don't see how I'm being a baby by trying to explain a concept to someone. "

PainMatrix,"Oh look, nobody opted to use their taxes for SSI **again**, sorry poor and disabled people. "
PainMatrix,I think average is well implied since this is a common argument.

EDIT: I'm doubling down: /r/wtf"
PainMatrix,I think most fundamentalists would agree with you. 
PainMatrix,"Well, her initial argument is right. Women do make less than men, but that's mostly an artifact of women and men making different occupational choices. Primarily, it's due to more men than women choosing to work full time. Before I get crucified for this, I do understand there are still gender biases in the work place and at educational institutions, I'm just saying that what accounts for most of the difference is self-chosen. "
PainMatrix,Is there anyone who wouldn't cyberstalk a prospective date to learn about them?

PainMatrix,"That's great insight, thanks!"
PainMatrix,Drugs.
PainMatrix,I'm sorry for your loss OP. I hope the rest of your family is close and supportive. 
PainMatrix,"I can see we don't agree. That's fine, I personally feel that no topic or taboo should be off limits when it comes to humor. "
PainMatrix,Humor is entirely subjective. The fact that my original post ended with positive numbers indicates there was an audience for this particular joke. 
PainMatrix,"{serious question} I'm a heterosexual male and women bodybuilders do nothing for me. Homosexual males, is this type of musculature a turn-on?"

PainMatrix,"You should've shown up earlier, this would have gone over big. "
PainMatrix,"Well good, seems you really learned something new today. That's great! Wow!"
PainMatrix,Are you by any chance familiar with the concept of satire? And talk about the pot calling the kettle black with your judgmental attitude towards southerners. 
PainMatrix,"Thank you /u/syphon8, that is exactly the meaning that I intended. "
PainMatrix,"Well exactly, that's my point. "
PainMatrix,And they get away with it because the kids eat up image. They're victims and perpetrators at the same time. 
PainMatrix,"I don't know much about reefer smoking peeps, but I do know I will clean house on peeps when I'm stoned. My record is 32."

PainMatrix,"Good old John Hammond, selling it to the bitter end. "
PainMatrix,"Thanks for letting me know, from now on I will add that I don't care if you take a few minutes to destroy my toilet with a massive shit. "
PainMatrix,It amazes me that the car way in front barely moved and the car behind that didn't move at all. They must have had a better view than what we saw. Don't people look at least a a few car lengths ahead of them when driving?
PainMatrix,"I always offer service people full use of restrooms as well as drinks. I want you guys to be comfortable, mostly so that you don't rip me off, because I have no clue what I'm doing. "
PainMatrix,Faggot! The incredible true story behind OP. 
PainMatrix,"We're all just clones. Well, maybe not, but we at least share many of the same experiences. "
PainMatrix,My only complaint is that it should read *freedom fries*
PainMatrix,"Ah yes, the elusive Texas Offshore Wind Energy Roundtable gang. They play dirty and will not hesitate to bathroom. "
PainMatrix,"You're an asshole. Sometimes you have no choice if the person next to you crossed the line. Either way, it's not worth destroying someone's property. "
PainMatrix,"OP, I believe you've just stumbled right the fuck on to a perpetual motion machine. "
PainMatrix,And someone else posted it 6 months ago. I remember because I remember commenting that you can just pour the cereal back into the box. 
PainMatrix,"Ha ha, you know what I meant!"
PainMatrix,"Wow, the imgurtranscriber was the highest rated comment! Cold. "
PainMatrix,"Well, there was a snake of sorts. And your dad was giving it to your mom like he was roto-rooting a clogged drain. "
PainMatrix,American. Do you like papa johns where you live?
PainMatrix,Can you expand on this? Is this what you think gives it that taste?
PainMatrix,"Love a good pizza stone, but also seriously lazy. "
PainMatrix,Whoever was doing the copy just said fuck it like a quarter of the way through. 
PainMatrix,"Seriously, congrats on the achievement OP, I hope you're proud!"
PainMatrix,"Yup. How's your life OP? Pretty good? Have friends you do fun stuff with, hang out and shoot the shit with? Do you have a bf/gf, someone who you can be intimate with? How are your future career and life prospects, not bad?

How about you let the special ed kids have their time on stage. "

PainMatrix,"Over papa johns for sure, but that's not saying much. "
PainMatrix,"I think you're right, but he initiated a comment to me. I can't argue with the downvotes, but I wanted him to specifically know that I heard him. In the end, still worth it. "
PainMatrix,Well said. 
PainMatrix,You could give me a plate of just caramelized onions and I'd be a happy man. 
PainMatrix,"I wish I could agree with you on the pizza. Tried it again a couple of months ago after a time away, it had this weird greasy chemically taste, and the texture of the dough is just god awful. "

PainMatrix,This is a great idea!
PainMatrix,"Well, you know the old expression, ""when life hands you lemons, they are easily convertible to a liquid of any citrus variant."""
PainMatrix,Upvoted!...

PainMatrix,"I don't get it. You have a DVR, but you still watch live television?"
PainMatrix,I'm willing to vouch for *not feel well get drunk*
PainMatrix,"Exactly. Also, if a person in front of you appears to be texting speed up until you're only about 3 feet from their bumper, then honk and flash your lights. "
PainMatrix,"Plus, this is an interest free loan to them! You would be much better off doing an assessment of your tax situation beforehand so that you end up getting no refund and investing that money!"

PainMatrix,OP what did you end up getting?
PainMatrix,"Ugh. I think I'll pass on that dish then, thanks. "
PainMatrix,Right. It just makes it that much more difficult to keep an erection if somebody's trying to have a conversation with me...
PainMatrix,"That thing was great. It played ""the people in your neighborhood."""
PainMatrix,"At least those are actual words, where on earth did pizzle come from? "
PainMatrix,Is anything we do on reddit *required*?
PainMatrix,Exactly. Our brains only have capacity for so much attention. It's constantly divvied up. It's the same reason I prefer not to have a conversation if I'm really into a meal. 
PainMatrix,"Either way what? Is that some kind of a veiled threat? I can see there's no convincing you otherwise, enjoy your self-satisfied feeling. "
PainMatrix,"He also said this: *Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.*
Yoda was a babbling old fool."
PainMatrix,"Look at the comment I was referring to, which was sex. The answer is still no. I plan on teaching them both safety and responsibility about that issue."
PainMatrix,Never said that. 
PainMatrix,"I hope I won't, but thanks. "
PainMatrix,Really? So I'm not entitled to some forethought?
PainMatrix,"That's exactly how I see it too. In fact, I see the kind of attitude depicted on the post as making things worse  "
PainMatrix,2
PainMatrix,Thanks! Didn't know the context. Still not a fan of this cliche though. 
PainMatrix,Now you're also a pedophile. My daughter is 2. 
PainMatrix,Agreed. 
PainMatrix,Good for you for being responsible and thoughtful in less than ideal circumstances. Stay true to yourself. :)
PainMatrix,"You raise an interesting question. I don't know what you guys have, but I will tell you this: the crunch and snap of lettuce and bacon on toast (a BLT) is texturally one of the greatest experiences ever. "
PainMatrix,I'm not playing anything dude. I legitimately feel it's weird to 1) be treating your daughter differently than your son (I have both) and 2)to be concerned with your kids sexuality once you've raised them. 
PainMatrix,"Thank you for that, based on some of these responses, not everyone feels the same way. "
PainMatrix,"Exactly, or a soggy BLT. Gross. "
PainMatrix,"Having a daughter I find this whole cliche pretty fucking weird. Are any other parents this concerned with their daughters sex lives? The only thing I would encourage is safety and responsibility, so to me the dude in this picture represents a complete lack of trust. "
PainMatrix,Is the seasoning more salt? 
PainMatrix,"As a parent, I actually don't care, I just want to be able to walk in there without stepping on a Lego piece, or a plug, or whatever the hell is on the front page at the moment. "
PainMatrix,"Nothing weird about that. If you can't be older and enjoy silliness and foolishness, what's the point?"
PainMatrix,"Ugh, I just gagged. "
PainMatrix,*Now introducing our junior redditor collection!* *cat not included. 
PainMatrix,"These things are the worst. Ate them all of the time just out of college because they're like $1 each. Also, aside from the awful taste and pitiful serving sizes, each of these has about a days worth of sodium. "

PainMatrix,"I wish I could give you what you want, but I can't. "

PainMatrix,Huh? This makes no sense whatsoever to me. Why would a person share their gambling winnings? Is everybody covering the losses? Explain yourself OP. 
PainMatrix,"Ha ha ha, have an upvote!"
PainMatrix,How awkward for you to bring that up. Sorry you had to be reminded of that. 
PainMatrix,But it's sweet and innocent.
PainMatrix,Why the fuck would this nice positive comment garner downvotes?
PainMatrix,We're taking imperial from you lot just like we took our freedom!
PainMatrix,What's the argument against it?
PainMatrix,"Nice, t-shirt weather!"
PainMatrix,"Where do you live in Australia, that's crazy?"
PainMatrix,Sex is universal. We are all beautifully disgusting sexual beings. 
PainMatrix,"Tl;dr stole life sized cap'n crunch figure, got prizes. My senior year of college General Mills had a bizarre contest at my school. They had these giant cap'n crunch figures at all of the cafeterias. These things were ripe for stealing! The weird thing was that when you stole one (which I did) there was a letter on the back saying you one a ton of prizes and to come to the student union on a certain date and time to claim them. It was legit and the only time in my life I've gotten rewarded for stealing.  "
PainMatrix,"Dude, you're nuts!"
PainMatrix,I reckon that kind of a thing'll get a man killed round these parts. 
PainMatrix,Make it happen!
PainMatrix,"/u/GrandMasterJR summed it up pretty well. You have some great ideas now about what you want out of life and your values etc. and hopefully you'll look for a spouse who feels similarly. But values and outlooks change; that's actually not a bad thing in a relationship. I think it has the potential to keep things interesting and you can expose one another to new ideas and experiences. Again though, the key is to talk about where you are and what you want for your kids.

A personal example: my wife is religious and I'm not. This has not always been easy, but she has actually made me a lot more tolerant and open to her experiences. In how we raise our kids we are able to take a hybrid approach to this, teach our kids our perspective and allow them to come to their own conclusion.

I wish you luck, stay open and honest."

PainMatrix,And I think the rest of the world (besides the US) would agree with you. 
PainMatrix,People love a semantic argument for some reason. A paradox (among it's other definitions) is a situation which appears contradictory. We don't have any more context to this situation so the definition fits. 
PainMatrix,That's the entire paradox and quandary. 
PainMatrix,100% agreed. It was a real sticking point for me too.

PainMatrix,"Okay, after watching that 26 times here's my analysis. I have no idea how the ""adult"" thought that this was going to work.

PainMatrix,"thanks psych101. you're talking about the techniques and methods and behavioral principles. The art of parenting is in the fluid and compromising application of those principles. The over-correction technique suddenly is no longer effective, but a time-out seems to work, etc. This is parenting away from the ivory tower."
PainMatrix,"&gt;art: the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination. 

Are you a parent, because this is the very fucking definition of parenting"
PainMatrix,I have to disagree with you based on my previous comment. As I'm not likely to persuade you otherwise at this point why don't we both just raise our drinks in honor of the weekend and toast!
PainMatrix,that's the longest time to reply to a comment I've yet to encounter. Upvote for you!
PainMatrix,Thanks for the openness and the insight!
PainMatrix,I think I just found a non-parent. 
PainMatrix,"Nobody knew until it was tested. And actually what this paper is suggesting is that it is not derived from a pressure to fit in, but rather related to a desire to NOT fit in. "
PainMatrix,"You can't know until you're there. I've found myself in some dark places, saying things I could never have imagined I was capable of.

PainMatrix,"Thanks for being willing to be open. 

I'm not a scholar of religions, so I can't say whether the tenets of each and every religion would agree with you. So instead let's take your specific point about mormons and alcohol. Here is a website from the mormon church that actually talks about this as a religious violation and uses the world ""law:"" 
http://www.mormon.org/faq/law-of-health
I think that's pretty telling that if you identify as Mormon you should definitely not be drinking alcohol. Here's a definition of hypocrisy: ""The practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess; falseness.""
Seems to fit. "
PainMatrix,"This is getting a lot of people upset for some reason. 

First off, here is a merriam-webster definition of a paradox: "" one (as a person, situation, or action) having seemingly contradictory qualities or phases.""

Second, Bill W. adhered to Judeo-Christian tenets of religion. I would implore you to find any that of those tenets that would condone adultery and seances. The fact that he struggled with his own infidelity is also telling. 

Beyond all that, as you say, then why identify with any particular religion? Wouldn't it be hypocritical to do so?"
PainMatrix,You're talking about AA. Bill was a judeo-christian adherent with a strong belief in god. This was a violation to his belief system.
PainMatrix,"seances and infidelity are contradictory with mainstream judeo-christian religion and therefore paradoxical. 
Edit (I need to expound on this because I'm getting downvotes): They are contradictory to the judeo-christian values that Bill W. accepted. In fact he himself struggled with these things and beat himself up over it. He was a paradox of opinions, values, and behaviors. As many of us are."
PainMatrix,All I'm saying is that the evidence we have demonstrates that abstinence only education doesn't work. You should find some way to at least mention that this has no scientific merit.
PainMatrix,Al White looks exactly like Darryl from the office.
PainMatrix,"If you're looking for an experience, look no further. New York's hottest club is Trash.

EDIT. as this comment is causing confusion. This is paradoxical to him b/c he was also a judeo-christian dude whose beliefs were in conflict with these actions. I'm not judging or condemning him, in fact I'm throwing us all into the mix. "

Feel free to reply and get ""the last word"" but I really can't keep explaining this. Also, I never downvoted you, can you say the same?"
PainMatrix,"That is good to know thanks. I am careful with not wasting food and using it all by the expiration date, but it sounds like I could extend that a bit. "
PainMatrix,"She's actually right. It's impossible to prove a theory. You have to eliminate with certainty alternative theories and you can strongly infer your theory is correct. Also, Nancy Grace is an idiot. "
PainMatrix,"Almost as good as the ""no-wipe"" or ""ghost-wipe."""
PainMatrix,"Fahhh, eh forget it. "
PainMatrix,You're not reading it correctly then. I don't know what else to tell you. 
PainMatrix,"It must work, because I don't see any tigers near you!"
PainMatrix,"Yes, any food that reaches that point. But, I try not to let it get to that point by being resourceful in my use of food. I don't see the contradiction here. "
PainMatrix,This seems to often happen with milk for some reason.
PainMatrix,*if it gets to that point. 
PainMatrix,Based on a single comment? You don't know how often I do this. In fact I'm very resourceful and conscientious regarding food. Based on your single comment I'm going to guess you're a self righteous asshole. Does that pretty much sum you up?
PainMatrix,"I don't care if it ""masks"" the flavor, I prefer ketchup to mustard on my hot dog. "

We're all individuals with varying thoughts and intentions, that's a good thing. "
PainMatrix,You're not wrong. Neither am I. 
PainMatrix,"I've also not downvoted you at all, that doesn't make me a good person, it doesn't make me a bad person. I came across this post while looking at the front page, so what? I don't think too much about particular subs when looking at reddit, I just look for interesting content, and thought this was an interesting post. I wanted to join in the discussion. This whole idea of exclusion doesn't sit well with me, and I don't think you and I will see eye to eye on that."
PainMatrix,"I get how you feel that way, I don't think you speak for an entire sub though. Reddits a weird place, but I think ultimately most of it is based on positivity and understanding. I hope for more of both of those things in your life. "

PainMatrix,How about snapping fingers? At the end of concerts just a crowd of people snapping their fingers. 
PainMatrix,Do you have a primary doctor? If not get one. Make an appointment. Let him or her know what's going on with you. They will refer you to specialists who can help you overcome this with the assistance of medication and/or therapy.

PainMatrix,He jumped from about 60 feet. Based on physics he would be going approximately 40 mph when he hit the ground. Even hitting a good snow bank that is incredibly fast and is probably lucky to be alive.
PainMatrix,"I assumed, I'm an ass, I apologize. Incidentally, I go through the same thing. I was brought up nonreligious and my wife is catholic. My observations have been the same. As I grew up and over the years I struggled to find meaning and to understand things from others perspective. I'm not saying that makes me a better person, but I do think it helped me to gain a better critical understanding of religious content. A good example of this is communion. My wife did not know that in the Catholic tradition, this is literally interpreted as taking the body of Christ, she had just been doing it for so long that it had lost any meaning."
PainMatrix,"The answer to your question is not that your friends are dumb, but that we come to understand things better when we struggle with them. Thinking about things critically leads to a deeper and better understanding of them. 
EDIT: are you looking for a particular answer? If not, how about engaging in a dialogue instead of downvoting. "
PainMatrix,"I don't know, I think the subreddit title sums it up pretty well. "
PainMatrix,Just because he walked away it doesn't mean he's okay. 
PainMatrix,The traveling is kind of what I see as an alternative to that. Things can never get so bad that you can't just leave and start new. 
PainMatrix,"This thought to me is amazing. I could get up in the morning, get dressed, walk out the door and be nearly anywhere on this planet within 24 hours. Amazes me to think about. "

PainMatrix,Didn't work out too well though....

PainMatrix,I'm glad I'm not alone on this. I love my job and my family but being adult isn't always easy.

PainMatrix,that is my fantasy dinner right there.
PainMatrix,this may be the one example of this meme that contradicts that.
PainMatrix,....but you can fast forward through them....
PainMatrix,Something about you seems familiar...
PainMatrix,And that's all I'm trying to say. But it's been my experience so far that a lot of redditors care more about submitting links then creating a dialogue.

PainMatrix,Butt I'd rather not!
PainMatrix,"My dear god, are you me?"
PainMatrix,Did you add sauce though?

PainMatrix,"That's what I thought, you had no specific critique, just wanted to sound smart. "
PainMatrix,"I suspect you're right. It's too bad, it's a good study. "
PainMatrix,"The blaze is just reporting as did many outlets. The study was published in personality and individual differences which has a fairly high standard, which I know because I've published there myself. "
PainMatrix,"I know quite a bit about the scientific method, what is your specific critique about the methods of this study?"
PainMatrix,"Hey tedesche, I'm OP. I agree with you about the NY post. Here's a similarly critical article from the APA http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2012/09/tall-tales.aspx
"
PainMatrix,"My god, I'm glad you asked ekolis because if you are a vampire you could literally have been killed if you progressed on that assumption. The cheese will absorb the V-rays (vampire-rays) and kill you dead (I assume you're a vampire). To avoid these rays, you need to wear a thin layer of cheesecloth which will strain out the excess cheese curds and you'll be safe."
PainMatrix,"Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water though. The bystander effect is a real phenomenon with a good body of research behind it. This, perhaps, may just not be the best example. "
PainMatrix,"Here's the biggest variable: nursing or formula? That makes a huge difference. Also, do you already have the initial set-up (i.e. crib, changing table, stroller, monitor, pack-and-play, etc.)? We got a bunch of hand me downs for clothing and the other stuff from friends and family (they go through that stuff so quickly I hope you have those same resources), so the only expense was diapers the first 6 months. The second 6 months when they start getting into finger foods we spent probably $30/week on that."
PainMatrix,http://i.imgur.com/TzKIYkR.jpg
PainMatrix,"Great observation turma_verinen, and the answer is it does! Where do you think we get cheese from? The moon has a fairly low VSMR (variable spectrum melting ratio); pieces of cheese fly off slowly and hover in the upper atmosphere (""stars"") before falling to earth (""comets"") where they are then mined and distributed."
PainMatrix,That cannot possibly be true. 
PainMatrix,"Never mind that she rented a VHS tape, where the hell are there still video stores?"
PainMatrix,OP I demand to know where the goddamn thin mints are!
PainMatrix,"Cheese absorbs the spectrum of rays that are lethal to vampires. As the moon is made of cheese, only the benign spectrum of rays is reflected. "
PainMatrix,Did you take the picture with the stuffed baked potato I assume she was eating?
PainMatrix,"Rocks, soil, or people; never would I trust anyone or anything that much. "
PainMatrix,At least there's an option to make a U-turn. 
PainMatrix,I fucking get that I was wrong. Uncle. 
PainMatrix,"Dear god I hope she doesn't have any elderly relatives on Facebook, or that know how to use the internet. "
PainMatrix,Well that makes me a stereotyping asshole. Thanks for the info.

PainMatrix,There is an arrow pointing to the spot...
PainMatrix,"These are okay, but in my opinion the most applicably useful experiment was from 1974 testing a concept called the misattribution of arousal. Male subjects were placed on a fear arousing suspension bridge or a non fear arousing bridge and asked by an attractive female interviewer to fill out questionnaires. Those who were approached on the fear arousing bridge mistook their arousal of anxiety for arousal of attraction and were more likely to call the interviewer for date. 

The applications for this are that if you are with a female or male in an anxiety or fear arousing situation they are likely to attribute that arousal for attraction. So take your dates to a scary movie tonight!"
PainMatrix,"Imagine your job is to talk for 4 consecutive hours daily while every single word is recorded and reviewed with a fine tooth comb. On the surface it seems like a cool job, but that piece of it must suck. "

PainMatrix,Always look for the silver lining!

PainMatrix,This is a comment. 
PainMatrix,"Of which there are millions. I'm not saying he's not a talented musician, but those are in abundance. "

PainMatrix,I can't stand this kind of manipulating of children who have no idea what they're doing. They're just trying to satisfy their caregiver. On the other hand she does look like a dumb sinner. 
PainMatrix,"To be fair though, I'd like to find a way to combine those things. "
PainMatrix,"The only way it could be more of a turnoff is if it just said ""Sam"" and Sam was wearing it. "
PainMatrix,Good point. Maybe I need to think about whether I'm the problem...or maybe some people (present company withstanding) are thoughtless!
PainMatrix,I incorrectly assumed it was implied. After your comment I reposted it to be more clear. Thanks!

PainMatrix,I have been in the past. I like to think I learned from it at this point. 
PainMatrix,There doesn't seem to be an explanation. I like to think it was just a long day followed by a late night and they just started getting punchy.

PainMatrix,Dates assholes. 
PainMatrix,Came here looking for a punch line...
PainMatrix,"I can speak to smoking. No. The department  of health and human services clinical practice guidelines initially recommended this, but their 2008 update found that there was no evidence for hypnotherapy working for smoking cessation. "

PainMatrix,"I get that, but you create their environment and they will seek out stimulation whether you provide it or not. I'm not raising my kids to be religious but I am teaching them to be respectful, thankful, and conscientious. All things I value. "
PainMatrix,Indoctrination is as much about what you don't do as what you do. Children learn from their environment and if it's important to you as a parent you want to expose your kid to it.

Follow your pediatricians advice, and just do a quick google search to give you some basic information in the meantime. "
PainMatrix,What you're describing sounds like panic disorder with a developing agoraphobia. There are great behavioral techniques that can include a combination of in vivo and interoceptive exposure. These techniques are extremely effective. Start with your primary provider and ask for recommendations and a referral. You don't have to live with this. Good luck.

PainMatrix,That's not uncommon. As you go through your sleep cycle from REM to NREM stage 1 you're nearly in a state of wakefulness. It can happen then too. People go through that shift 3-6 times per night. 
PainMatrix,"Even if something seems obvious it may not actually be real. A good example of this is many people believe and state the aphorism ""opposites attract."" However it's been demonstrated that although people claim to want someone who is different from them they end up choosing someone who is similar, the matching hypothesis. But we didn't know this for sure until we tested it."

PainMatrix,"ZK, you've been given an opportunity. An honest to goodness opportunity to hit back at your anxiety. Here's what you need to do: sit with it, feel it, feel the palpitations of your heart, the sweat in your hands...let the thoughts come, the scary ones...and face them, let them out write them down, yell them. Don't try to look away from what's happening in your body or your mind or escape (including going online). You know it won't hurt you, but your anxiety doesn't. This is an opportunity to show it."
PainMatrix,"Be assertive, kind but firm, and rehearse a conversation ender that suits your style. You're at work, where you have responsibilities, which should make things easier. Something along the lines of, ""I hear what you're saying, but you'll have to excuse me, I have to finish stacking some books."" If for some reason someone is upset or offended by this (which I would be very surprised by), that's their problem not yours. Good luck!"

PainMatrix,This was reprinted in 2002....
PainMatrix,"Wow, nice of you to say. She's just a naturally bright and inquisitive kid. It's much more about her than me. "
PainMatrix,"My first word book. Everything else in it is what you'd expect of a ""first word."""
PainMatrix,"No, it's just a general word book. It has 2 pages of farm animals and this was one of them. "
PainMatrix,"They finally did it.

PainMatrix,"Hey melly, what you describe can be characteristic of bipolar II. It can also just be pure depression which is marked by recurrent cycles of depression and recovery. The bottom line is that you should be meeting with a mental health professional not just a general practitioner. "
PainMatrix,"Ha, awesome. 
Edit: on here 1 day. Learned any response gets down votes as soon as you've already been made to look like an asshole. Thanks for the lesson. "
PainMatrix,Point out to me where you see enough vehicles to accommodate 500 people. 
PainMatrix,This couldn't possibly have anything to do with the fact that 500 people are thronging in the middle of the road.
PainMatrix,"Well, does it go:
""ding ding ding di di ding ding… ding ding ding di di ding ding?""
Or does it go: 
""ding ding ding di di ding ding… DING… ding ding ding di di ding ding??????"""
PainMatrix,You're welcome. 
PainMatrix,(Nice dream)
PainMatrix,"Although you may mean social anxiety, I'm actually going to attempt to answer your question. A measure often used for assessing introversion/extraversion is the NEO, a 5-factor model of personality. Most research shows that people with ADHD are not only higher on extraversion and neuroticism, but also agreeableness and conscientiousness. Basically, that means someone with an ADHD diagnosis is more likely to be open, slightly anxious, wants to go with the flow, and thinks about consequences. 

This may have absolutely nothing to do with your question, but I hope it helps."
PainMatrix,"Does ""people"" include soulless bloodsucking corporations?"
PainMatrix,"I hope to god this was eaten and not just immediately thrown into a dumpster. Can't find sources stating but here's the story.

PainMatrix,"That's true, but offset by the push of a publishing house behind you with the ability to market and reach many many more potential consumers. "
PainMatrix,Definitely her. I feel constant regret. 
PainMatrix,"This probably more fits a douchey category. When I was 16 I broke up with this girl around mid-summer. Then I wrote a poem about how materialistic she was, had it published in the school literary magazine, with the title just being a variation of her name. It makes me cringe thinking about what dick I was and how much I must have embarrassed her."
PainMatrix,"Hey invincible,

I've gotten a few empirical articles published and am working on a book myself. You've got a number of different options. There are websites that will give you option to self-publish, but will take a large cut (anywhere from 60-90%) of sales. Amazon for examples takes 70%. 

Another option is to find the names of some publishing houses that are publishing similar material. E-mail the actuarial editors at these places (you can find them on their websites), and ask them if they would be interested in a proposal. 

Good luck!"
