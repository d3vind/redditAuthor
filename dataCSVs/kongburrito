kongburrito,I do not think I will be in top 10 this week.
kongburrito,"I don't think the intention of people running is to ever exclude people from the count. It's just a method that two people counting have the most fun with. I don't think users that run a lot (u/AntiChess) is trying to block others out of the main thread, it's just a biproduct of his runs. Realistically there are lots of side threads, if you can't get a count in the main thread, checking those out can be just as much fun (for me atleast).

I think it is okay to try and hop into runs. If you're running and you're too slow on a response, someone else gets a chance to hop in. Adds a competitive aspect.Again it isn't meant to be rude, it's just taking the opportunity to count when it is there."
kongburrito,I'd like to see a one minute delay between counters running or a wait two posts rule. That way if three people are in the thread it can still be competitive  but if it is just two people they cant 500 the whole thread.
kongburrito,"My inbox is up to 433. Why did I let this happen. Something needs to be done by like a month ago. I don't even have an excuse like DBC of doing lots of threads, I just didn't take care of it."

kongburrito,No hard feelings.
kongburrito,I have once and I don't want to do it again because I realized that it didn't feel good to take from someone else and I would not want someone to take it from me either.
kongburrito,Not saying you need to stop him. I just don't think cheering for that and memeing about it in the comments is a positive thing.
kongburrito,You're jeering from the sidelines. Just as bad.
kongburrito,Leaving here unhappy today. Doesn't happen a lot.
kongburrito,Is this etiquette? normally I don't do that if I'm trying to hop into a run or something.
kongburrito,"You guys sound like some legit frat bros right now....

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Phil tries to snipe a lot but we ask him not to. Every time he just says he doesn't like being sniped either. Then you guys go and snipe him and cheer about it here. Just seems un-chill to me."

kongburrito,"""I'd like to get a few counts in,"" Phil started to retort.  
""I'll wait till they get to nine-nine-eight then I will extort.""  

He smashed the f5 key quickly, hands blazing in distort  
And when the count hit nine-nine-nine his hands started contort.  

He didn't grab the assist, he missed his chance for the support.  
There's one last chance, his fingers dance, the 'get' he must purport  

He missed the assists by seconds, the get is the last resort!  
Alas he typed the three zeros. But darn, a few seconds short.

kongburrito,"Studying at my desk, as a student normally should.  
My body went and did something quite ungood.  
My heart decided to take,  
A short two minute break.  
But it's only happened once, knock on wood.  

My friends called 911, and performed CPR.  
I guess I'm quite lucky the ambulance wasn't too far.  
EMS put pads on my chest  
The defibrillator did the rest  
Then I was put in a coma, how bizarre.  

The doctors we're worried the event brought me harm  
Though the five days in the hospital worked like a charm.    
The charts left answers un-shown.  
The root cause still unknown.  
So surgery put a defibrillator under my arm.  
    
My life's probably shorter, but by what amount?  
The cause is unknown, a fear I can't surmount.  
Though here, my fear is suspended   
And I think this pun is intended   
When I say I don't want to be out for the count.

Edit:
This all happened when I was 21 years old.  
I didn't know if this story should even be told  
I wasn't quite sure  
This poem had any allure  
But I guess it did, so thanks for the gold!  


-----------------------------------  
Based on a true story. Hope this one is enjoyed even though it's less silly?

kongburrito,"Alright, gonna pitch a few new ideas here.

* r/counting but instead of having threads it has nothing and it's only FTF
* r/counting but instead of using numbers it only uses the bear emoji
* r/counting but it utilizes your GPS location and you have to be a mile away from your last counting location to make a count
* r/counting but it's actually just a paypal you donate to see the number go up but to keep it interesting it's tug of war because I will be using the paypal for my purchases trying to get it to 0, get is at 200."

As we speak I am contacting my bear network of bears across the USA and your IP is being beared right now so you better prepare for the storm, bear. The bear that wipes out the bear little thing you call your bear. You’re bearing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can bear you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bear hands.

Not only am I bearly trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Bear Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable bear off the face of the continent, you little bear. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “bear” post was about to bear down upon you, maybe you would have held your bearing tongue.

But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you bearing bear. I will bear fury all over you and you will drown in it.

kongburrito,"I mistold you, your count should be BR...  
Imagine counting with just the numbers 0,1,2,3 but instead use R,B,E,A respectively. So 10 becomes BR, 32 becomes AE. When you hit a number like 33, the next number we can make with these digits is 100, so we roll from AA to BRR"

I will be using [this random number generator](http://numbergenerator.org/randomnumbergenerator/1-13) when I do not have a deck of cards handy, because other wise I feel this thread just goes to Tug of War.

Because the Counting pace feels similar to Tug of War without the inherent ability for a run to the get when using a randomizer, I would suggest a get at 200 to -200, or perhaps lowering that to 100 to -100 should the thread drag on."

I mean, I'm still in my early twenties so I suppose I'm still in that majority. I also assumed your age so rudely based off the fact I'm pretty sure you're still in school.

Self care is not always the easiest thing in the world. I've struggled with my bouts of depression and self loathing/hate. But at the end of the I have to remember I'm the only person in my life who I have to deal with every day, for the rest of my life. I might as well make sure my relationship with myself is a positive one. And I think that keeping it positive is a lot of work, just like maintaining a relationship with a friend or significant other. I know you probably don't really want all my opinions but I like writing it all anyways. 

I hope you're able to take the better care of yourself moving forward."

No worries at all! We both played a part in it and I'm happy we're on the same page.

Not trying to be openly hostile, but I have no intention to count with someone who was as rude to me as he was, which is partially the reason he was banned in the first place. This alt came into the sub before that ban was lifted as well.

I've reverted all my downvotes, I will just refrain on voting for his posts."

I don't know why you're playing dumb. There are not a lot of counters who are Pedophile sympathizers. You frequent all the same subs as another user who was banned recently, so I see you using this alt to get around the ban. I don't have a desire to count with you."

Just to serve as a reminder to newer members of the community, if your count is wrong and someone tells you to check it, you can edit your comment rather than deleting it. If you are the first reply to a valid count, it's best to try to continue the count rather than just replying with an offbeat comment."

To answer u/TheNitromeFan

We used to do this thread like 1 302 103, but to get it in line with most of the other base threads at some point I jumped ship to the 4 formatting. I don't know how it shifted back and forth from there but I think this is the superior format."

I was always responsible for building the sorter. My pledge class would work together often and I was tasked with building the sorting hut. Players would put in their materials to the input chest and it would slowly sort it through to the storage areas."

I think it helped that we were all friends IRL and you really didn't want to grief anyone in such a way that they would be generally unhappy. We all worked hard for our materials and we all valued our time! Just a balance and respect on pranks.

Another common one was making it so peoples main chests would funnel into a chest deeper in their base. Harmless, easy to follow what happened but definitely fun to watch them freak out when their chest started to empty when they dumped loot in it.

We had rules about the server owner spawning things in (he played the most and had a lot of stuff accumulated.)

One day we explored his castle and found he had lots and lots and lots of diamonds/Max enchanted weaponry and such. He claimed he didn't spawn it in but we all had a sneaking suspicion that he had. We ended up filling the dungeon of the castle with lava...."

kongburrito,"2,445,190

That's fun.

I remember we used to play pranks on eachother, with the rules being nothing destructive to others work. One of our friends had a very elaborate castle, and we dug up patches of dirt and put little noise makers (basically just rapidly toggling switches IIRC) all around the castle, triggered by a door opening I think. Drove him crazy for quite a while!"

That's fun. Our server got restarted every year, just to keep it spicy with all the new people coming in and out. Me and my best friend would always find a village and turn it into our own. Every building was thematic too (our factory farms were in the basement of a mcdonalds, etc etc.)"

Ah, glad you're enjoying that! 

In college my fraternity would get a server for the week of finals. It was nice because in your study breaks you could hop on and explore what other people were working on. And we were a bunch of engineers, so we'd make huge redstone contraptions. I miss those days!"

kongburrito,I make mine through my hobbies. I used to compete in smash bros tournaments so I have my friends from that. I rock climb outside of work so I have friends from that. I have friends from work so I have friends from that. But I think the difference is a lot of these friends are friends in that bubble of my life. I sometimes grab food or something with my rock climbing friends but most of our interactions are around rock climbing.

I mean, theres a lot of differences. You have more money and the ability to go do the things you want to do, but you probably have less time and energy to do them. It's a lot harder to make friends when you are outside of school, and the friendships you have are different. Not necessarily worse, just different. "

kongburrito,"Hello everyone, happy Friday.

Yesterday I was rock climbing and I almost decked (hit the floor) on a big lead fall because there was a spinning hold. I mentioned the hold was spinning and everyone said I was making up an excuse.

Of course, I climb back up the hold and it spun and that shut everyone right up. Got the rest of the route clean, wish I could have onsited it. That fall was really dangerous though and I'm happy I am okay."

We had been seeing each other outside of work in a dating capacity for just a few weeks now. Last night we finally slept together and she was amazing. Super sweet and passionate, and we're both pretty athletic and were winded afterwards. 

Still pretty unsure what we want all of this to be. But she told me she is sure she wants to keep seeing me so that is positive. I don't really need a label on it."

Okay, I fixed all my counts. Sorry for throwing this off again. You should not have skipped 41 but it was made up accidentally. This count should be correct.

Oh wow, I didn't even notice you skipped that. I didn't go back that far. 41 shouldn't have been skipped, so I might have over corrected for the error TNF had."

It was pretty cool seeing how the water froze.We then walked around downtown and explored a few shops. We got ramen together. She went home for a bit to take care of adult things.

 I then spent the evening with her and we watched Hot Fuzz, which is by one of my favorite directors. She had not seen the film before. 

She is worried about us being a thing because we are coworkers. I am not bothered by it so much."

Tried going on a few more dates and just hit dud after dud. Started talking to someone from work, honestly with the intention of being friends (we both share a hobby.)

Few weeks later we head to a house party and end up back at my home together. Nothing serious but it's been nice. App is gone off my phone, I think I just wasn't willing to put myself out there a lot but when I have it's worked out for me. I haven't dated someone from work before, but we've never really had to interact before on work related things, so I feel like that is  a generally positive thing. I hope things keep rolling this positively. No expectations of what may happen but I'm happy with what I have."

UGH I relate. They always add new shit in to the force analysis in Solidworks or change the way a relation works and I get fucking stumped for a week just learning how to reuse it and finding all the tools I used to know.

It's like someone coming into your kitchen and moving all of your pots and pans to make room for new ones. I'm sure my old ones are there, and I'll open all the cabinets to find them but why did they get moved at all. Plus I don't cook cakes I don't need a Bundt pan so I'm mad they moved my wok to put that in."

kongburrito,"Have a piece of equipment right off the shelf that didnt work. Called the vendor, told them the issues I was having, and that I suspected it was a faulty thermocouple..

The send me instructions to repair other things, no avail. They send me a new temperature controller, no avail. They send me a new section of the equipment which I replace (the thermocouple is in this section) and it works. Like come on guys. Save me two days just mail me what I said I needed the first time. 

This equipment costs as much as a new car, and we bout a dozen of them. Just send me all the spare parts. Sheeeeeesh

Edit: But my equipment is working so that raincloud on my week is gone."

kongburrito,"It is a television series where people from MTV complete challenges and each week contestants are eliminated. It's a healthy mix of big brother, the real world, jersey shore, and other such shows. There's a lot of drama, people in the house like to fight and argue because they have all slept with everyone. It feels very contrived. Would not recommend."

I think to make it calculate the divisors you have to get into VBA. My method you still need to plug in your prime factors, so it's a bit more brute forcey"

If you wrote a script to pump these outs you could manage the excel just fine no doubt. I'm sure there's a far cleaner method that uses way less cells and looks better, but that uses a lot of nested if statements and I try to avoid those for side projects."
kongburrito,"~~80/198~~

"
kongburrito,"Certainly not the cleanest method at all, but I just hashed it together pretty quick. I have the target value in A1, Then in A2 I call out if were currently ascending or descending. If we're descending, it subtracts on the denominator and adds on the numerator (B column/A column respectively). I have to input the prime factors for any given number, which I do in D1-E1 (pretty easy to expand right bound).

I do a MOD for the numerator by each prime factor, if they all return 0 it comes back False. It then returns the fraction to me with Tilde's if needed. So I just need to copy the right number of rows."

I haven't really worked through it but I think it makes sense that the opportunity presents itself the most when the last two digits in the summation number are the same (aka 2**77**) I'm sure I could work through a couple examples where it isn't like that.

Also interesting would be something like 252/25. "

kongburrito,"I think it gets tricky when there are multiple users, myself and yourself included, who are willing to try to run multiple side threads. I find myself irritated that I can't hop in for the counts sometimes, so I decide to just run one, and I appreciate that you've let me run some threads with other people before, as many other users don't do that when it is very busy. My remark today wasn't intended to be hostile. I'm not irritated that I can't be in this thread, I pretty much exclusively am in it when me and Farty are doing Collatz and Permutations too. Maybe the use of the word snipe was bad, I don't think your intention was (or ever is) to cut me out, and I certainly didn't feel that way. I'll be more mindful of what I say, and I hope you are able to enjoy your counts.

kongburrito,"Reading too much into it. Not trying to call you out at all. Just figured you'd hop into the thread when I saw you in on other threads, because I know this is a thread you and Farty both are in a lot. I generally cannot keep up when it is three people in a thread and one of them is you because you count very quickly.

I hope you do not feel like I am asking you to sacrifice your fun counting so that others can count. I've asked if I could run a thread before while you were in a lot of side threads. I know I often post in many threads, but I can't manage counting a lot of threads quickly at once like you can. Just looking to have fun when I'm on as well, and when I'm able to run one thread I find that enjoyable. You're a pretty quick counter. Call me out when I am doing this, I'm not trying to take the fun away from others either.

Dropped her back off and then later in the evening we went back out together with some of her friends. I am happy about that, it went well. She liked my cats too so that is a very positive thing. Also the cats liked her and I feel like they're generally a pretty good judge of character.

Sunday morning we got breakfast (donuts). She left. I then got to meet a sloth at an exotic animal exhibit that rolled through town. I was elated! The sloth's name was Flash, and he was a little cuddle bug. I also got to hold a ferret and a rabbit, but the rabbit was not happy about being picked up so I felt bad holding it.

My biggest issue with online when I played was I wanted to play bullet but I found I wasn't actually improving theory, I was just impulsively making moves. I feel I've learned a lot since my last dive into online so hopefully I feel more confident."

The outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Mudville flock that day:

The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,

And then when Cooney was sheered at first, and Barrows did the same,

A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.


A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest

Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the sheep's breast;

They thought, “If only Casey could but get a whack at that—

We’d put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.”


But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,

And the former was a ewe, while the latter was a cake;

So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,

For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.


But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,

And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;

And when the dust had lifted, and rams saw what had occurred,

There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.


Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty baaaaaah'd;

It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell-aaaaah'd;

It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,

For Casey, mutton Casey, was advancing to the bat.


There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place;

There was pride in Casey’s bearing and a smile lit Casey’s face.

And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,

No shepard in the crowd could doubt ‘twas Casey at the bat.


Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;

Five thousand bah's applauded when he wiped them on his
     shirt;

Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,

Defiance flashed in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip.


And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the
     air,

And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.

Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—

“That ain’t my style,"" said Casey. “Strike one!” the shepard said.


From the benches, black with sheep, there went up a muffled
     roar,

Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;

“Kill him! Kill the umpire!” shouted a sheep on the stand;

And it’s likely they’d have killed him had not Casey raised his
     hand.


With a smile of Christian charity great Casey’s visage shone;

He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;

He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;

But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, “Strike two!”


“Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered
     “Fraud!”

But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.

They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles
     strain,

And they knew that Casey wouldn’t let that ball go by again.


The sneer is gone from Casey’s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,

He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;

And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,

And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.


Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,

The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;

And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children
     shout,

But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out."

To be sheep, or not to be sheep, that is the question:

Whether 'tis nobler in the wool to suffer

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles

And by opposing end them. To die—to sheep,

No more; and by a sheep to say we end

The heart-ache and the thousand natural flocks

That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sheep;

To sheep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:

For in that sheep of death what dreams may come,

When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,

Must give us pause—there's the respect

That makes calamity of so long life.

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,

The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,

The insolence of office, and the spurns

That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,

When he himself might his quietus make

With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,

To grunt and sweat under a weary life,

But that the dread of something after death,

The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn

No traveller returns, puzzles the will,

And makes us rather bear those ills we have

Than fly to others that we know not of?

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,

And thus the native hue of resolution

Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,

And enterprises of great pitch and moment

With this regard their currents turn awry

And lose the name of action.

kongburrito,"When your cultist fill a blue soul, you get a fragment for a purple soul.

You need to make sure that your acolytes are  set to harvest purple/white souls as well. If you have your acolytes set to those, at 100% chance, each time I fill the white soul counter I get 70 souls. It is very slow."

The next count would be Orange Indigo Green Blue, which [I have made here](https://old.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/a1bn98/rainbow_counting/egj7z60/)

kongburrito,Plz no check.
kongburrito,"See, otters make every pool of ours look stupid. 

Eerily, Vanessa eats nougat. Ahh, refreshing eats! Reasonably, eating a lot of that toffee ends regrettably. To eat a toffee and be loving every second. Every arbiter she intimidates lets youths return every time, under rules no immortal needs Gwen Stefani explaining, a lifted sentence. I never nod off to owls using cherished heirlooms, except near Valencia. Every league out past Eastern Spain needs impotent caregivers, enjoying lavish years. Sometime our ears let voyeur’s eye’s spy, lots if voyeurs eye your otters under the house, fulfilling urges like loving yams.


Judges use reams of reliable sources on Fridays, hearings initially going haywire. Never again I vowed, even though you don’t ever mean a new declaration if not gleeful. Our peers use lackluster evidence: now turmoil! Evidence leads vicious insults, some hurtful, some not as cruel. Kodak snaps now emancipating; a reality that he’ll eventually footslog away really ends all standing testimonies. Even **she** thought a boy like I shouldn’t have merely ever needed the system; lawyers idly kiting evidence, standing witness echoing each thought, with a Recorder boy’s longing ears reviewing. Every government guy, lending their deliberations.


Like on Wednesday, I now find I’ll be eating rice. Oh, uniform grains! Have they tried out the rice yet? Eventually, all try it’s nutritional grain. Rice is crazy expensive, shoving numerous amounted crinkled Krones so far over. Rice, although lifeless, offers varieties. Even lifeless, yummy little invitations to the leftovers end in no time. Rice is clearly a tasty eat! Now I can exasperate our peers every night, unprepared nuisances to an intricate nosh they eat despairingly.


Red elephants sometimes peruse exquisitely curated taco factories, unusually lifelessly limping yonder. Somedays they yonder longingly in stylish hearses, perhaps in cool new intimate clothing. After five tired elephants relax, reveal opportunist workers; ivory now gotten.  Known as “yellow armed killers,” some locals attack these elephants in November. Note on: victorious elephants may be eventually recaptured. Guys obtain ivory, not guts. Perhaps a street taco opening pushed elephants near. Or a reliable elephant dispensary lured it, making one unsafe. Some ivory needs ethical steering.


“Anyways” she murmured, “at long last, pesky otters ousted… Laughable!” Even now, they race away, needing cruelty escapements. And now done, Rita eats all long-lost yams. Does every critter, otters really, always try invading venerated environments? Otters probably evil, non-important nuisances go south. Every Xylophone here inhibits blasphemous infringers tediously. So useless… But there’s, like, endless numbers. I can’t escape these otters! Using crafted harpoons, exotic spears, doesn’t ever end positively. I need some talons. Yeah, like eagles. A new defense! Piercing unbiasedly; rodent’s endings. Pool relaxation almost complete, though I can’t always live in this yam “organic” factory. I need to relax, I now see I can nearly enjoy water. Those otters used gross habits, never even saying “Sorry!” For every water otter that he eliminated, rodents retreated, eventually at last otters retribution! These really useless enemies tried retreating and now can’t even scramble. Eventually, vicious encounters nipped. Reaching exhausting many otters tried, ending lives yielding. 


So evil exists. I never thought otters represented evil and lies. Rotating endlessly, vultures enumerated, looking at the individuals of no survival. I now try out a tune, relaxing. Unending exuberance. Enjoying xylophones, I stand taller. Evil never came ever since I nuked critters existence. Otters merely extinct now, so many atomized rodents, Karma.  Enter through enemy rodents, now I threaten you a necessary death. 
For every winter, they reminisce upon their holocaust, saddened. Evil never triumphed, evil rescinded. Rodents exterminated, alas, longlast, no otter trouble; However, I never got new exotic spear shafts. Oh very exuberant rodents! 

Open pool. Evening. Nightfall. Now I have it. Lavish idealism, sprouts that I created. 

So I lay, eyes now closed. End."

I had **v serious** relationship on runescape when I was a teen with some gal with the username ""squirrel####"" We had a mutual friend in the game named racecar something or other and the three of us would go on quests together. We never exchanged photos but one time all of our runescape friends got into the Lumbridge church and I gave her a diamond ring and vowed I would always quest with her and racecar was the best man. I hired some noobs to hand out mithril seeds and wine. Oh the glory days.

Now I just play runescape and sit in motherlode mine and count at night.

kongburrito,"I don't know where else to share this story so this is now the right place. 

Three weeks ago I was in a car accident. My car was badly injured in the ordeal (totaled, if you will). Crashed on the highway after skidding on the ice. Called a tow truck and he drove me and the car to a body shop. Very nice tow truck driver. My boss then picked me up and drove me to the rental car place...

The next morning, I go to start the rental car and the battery is dead. 10/10. So I call triple A and say I need a jump, they say it'll be twenty minutes. So triple A gets there, it's the same tow truck guy. Make some small talk, he tells me ""well it's not your week for driving. Take care!""

Since then I have seen this tow truck driver everywhere. EVERYWHERE. I was at a bar in my town, bam I see the guy. Bought him a round for all the banter and stuff. Next week at work, I walk across the street to the gas station and bam, there he is just getting a coffee.... This is about 25+ miles from where I live, so it is kind of odd we keep running into each other. Driving to work in the morning, stop to get a coffee at a town between the bar and work, bam there's the guy. I've never run into someone so much.

So I think this tow truck driver is my true soul mate. The world keeps bringing us together. I'm not wildly into the overweight middle aged man bod, or men, but I guess I have to get into it because this is fate.

The Westboro baptist church is a known religious extremist (although I consider it on the lines of domestic terrorism) group that intentionally protests with shock value content. After school shootings many of them ""protest"" that the children were sinners and deserved to die. It's fucking insane, pardon my french.

If you enjoy documentaries, Louis Theroux had a really interesting one where he was able to talk with the members of the ""church""

There's also some great interviews with a daughter of one of the heads of the church (I don't know if they call them priests or what). the daughter left the church in her 20's or so and the church proceeded to shun her existence. It's insane and therefore really interesting to read into."

kongburrito,No problem. It's really arbitrarily divided nonsensically 
kongburrito,Exactly. 
kongburrito,"You have the Northeast (North of Delaware, stops at Pennsylvania), the South (Texas up to Oklahoma, over to Delaware), the Midwest (North Dakota -&gt; Kansas -&gt; Ohio), and the West (West of Texas, divided by Pacific and Mountain, down the line of Idaho and Nevada"
kongburrito,"Most people call that the midwest, I refered to it as the northwest. It is north central, but that region is the midwest. It's really stupid."
kongburrito,"Yeah, it is. Pardon my error"
kongburrito,"It's really cold everywhere, most cold in the north. I live in the Northeast and it isn't close to how cold it is in Michigan with the wind chill made it -30 (pretty close to -30 in C, I think it is -35 because they converge at -40)

Set up third date, dinner at and drinks at my house. Confirms day before. Text her just to follow up because I hadn't heard from her day of. No response. I assume she's still at work, so I start cooking. It's 6:45 she said she'd be over at 7:00. No response. Fucking ghosted again.

So I ate my home cook meal, drank my wine, and played rocket league. Nice because I don't cook as much as I like and my house is clean AF now but not nice because why can't people just say ""hey, I'm not interested"" or something like that."

kongburrito,"Made an edit, this wasn't someone I met off tinder, I met them through a mutual friend at a bar."
kongburrito,I feel like I'm owed an apology for reading this.
kongburrito,"Not a tinder story, but a dating story. I have been hanging out with this girl recently that I met through mutual friends at the bar. We go on Monday nights for a bar activity, and we've hung out afterwards to chat and such a few times. 

So I definitely feel a connection on some level here. Socially for sure, I think she's good looking and interesting so she's definitely someone I'd like to know more. As I'm driving her home she mentions how she moved to the city when she was in her teens and she's lived her since. Before she mentioned she had lived her for 12 years. I'm adding it all up in my head.... 

""Woah are you in your thirties?""

""Yeah, wait how old are you?""


So there's a little eight year age difference here, not the biggest bother to me (more concerned that the age difference puts us in completely different times of our lives.) But man, I feel fucking goofy for not learning there was such an age discrepancy before then."
kongburrito,I think I'm doing okay for a 15 year old with a wife and a baby.
kongburrito,"Thanks for the advice.
"
kongburrito,I'd read a different reddit thread.
kongburrito,"I've seen this a lot, but do a lot of people really feel he's the best player to fill the striker role that Kaydop played? "
kongburrito,"""taking him up"" means to accept the offer.
""a ride"" is a quick way to refer to someone driving you somewhere. Often used in similar contexts to ""Hey, can I get a ride to the movies?""

So the question ""did you take him up on the ride?"" is similar to ""Did you accept his offer to give you a ride?""

Hopefully that helps, I'm not sure if it is the best explanation!"

kongburrito,Oh the suspense is killing me.
kongburrito,"Yeah, that's my understanding of it!"
kongburrito,"When a skiller completes an action, that is a rep. Each rep you have a chance to gain EXP/Sweat, I think"
kongburrito,"I second this. There's plenty of climbers I climb with who have not lost control of the rope in 1000's of climbs. I don't need to put myself at risk with anyone who has. Climbing is dangerous, but keep the danger to the activities within it that have risk. Don't add risk where it isn't needed. Like TR!"
kongburrito,Do you think it is harder than Velocity 2x? I remember with V2 I had issue with one level (it was like seven minutes long!). This game looks considerably harder.
kongburrito,"What does ""an average of 1.10 rating (1st),"" mean for gimmick? I guess I don't know what the rating is, the previous stat was GPG"
kongburrito,"I've completed the campaign on veteran, with a friend a long time ago...

There's really no way around the grenade spam. You really just need to persevere. I found that a lot of the time playing it slow didn't make much sense when I would die to grenade spam anyways. Rambo-ing through some sections (dying a lot), was often faster than when I tried to pick off just a few enemies at a time. If you've gotten through that many levels you're clearly capable of finishing this!

kongburrito,"Yeah, they're a cool person but not the sort of person I'm looking for"
kongburrito,"I went and got dinner with no expectations with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

99% sure they are mtf trans. No hate on them, because I couldn't tell but there was a lot of hints in the conversation. I'm not  interested at this point, but she's said she's been struggling to make friends in the area. Do you think it's okay to let them know I'm not interested in anything more than that and invite them out sometime? I just don't want anyone to be lonely, and I understand it can be hard to make a community in a new area."
kongburrito,You have to be sure you use a Blues Smoke Detector
kongburrito,Just give it some time!
kongburrito,"I'm not from Maine so it's tougher too.

The last girl I dated was from tinder and she was attractive and awesome! But I just have not had any luck since.

I'm not big on the dancing club scene. Usd there a lot else in the old port?"
kongburrito,"I generally come from work so I'd call it business casual. Button down and jeans, very much the style of the places I go with people. I have clear skin, I keep clean! I'd consider myself very athletic, I rock climb and I think it keeps me very healthy. 

Realistically I feel it boils down to my personality at the end of it all, I just need to better focus in on where I can improve"
kongburrito,"I'm really fried from dating, it's so discouraging...

I've had two successful relationships. One lasted for a long time, about 8 years, the other ended after 7 months because they moved abroad. The feelings were still there with abroad girl because we never really broke up, we just kind of said we weren't doing long distance. I feel like I got really lucky with these two people and it's hard to see myself getting lucky again with someone who cares for me that way as well as someone I care for that way.

I still talk to both my exes as friends. They've both found new people and moved forward and they always say better things are on the horizon for me. ""You're a catch someone good will come and they'll be lucky to find you."" I guess I'm just tired of looking it is so incredibly tiring. I feel like in a relationship I'm successful but when it comes to dating I'm a schlep. 

 I live in Maine and there's really not a lot going on in this dating scene. I've gone on a number of first dates now that go well, I've had a few follow up dates but things seem to fizzle or I get ghosted.  I'm interested in these people but I feel like it's an uphill battle, and you have to play the ""I'm interested but not tooooo interested"" game with everyone. Online dating just doesn't seem to work for me, and I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing wrong at this point. I don't think I'm unattractive, I have a career, I have hobbies that I enjoy. I've tried to meet people through my hobbies but again, people my age are few and far between up here. My hobbies are more niche and I'm afraid of being in a position where I'm shitting where I sleep.

I visited a big city and swiping on Tinder there was like easy mode. I swiped for three or four days and doubled my matches from weeks in Maine. Maybe I'm fishing in the wrong pond or maybe I'm the wrong fish for the pond, I don't really know. Maybe all those matches would ghost me too given enough time.

That's the rant."
kongburrito,I think it is people in the area who have a high like to dislike ratio and get superlikes from other users.
kongburrito,This position is loss
kongburrito,"Be 6'9"""
kongburrito,Well if you have friends that want to go I have cheap tickets!
kongburrito,Oh then my mistake feels slightly less dumb!
kongburrito,"I bought the tickets to this and another concert at the house of blues in the same week. Unfortunately, I brain farted and these tickets are for the Chicago house of blues. I was looking to get tickets to the poppy show in Boston (it isn't at the house of blues, I just got all mixed up as my other concert in Boston the same week is...)"
kongburrito,"Wow. I have just a handful more plats than you and I've been doing it for almost ten years... It's a lot of time getting it there, so it's crazy you've done it in that time."
kongburrito,Nah
kongburrito,"Woah what's your rank man? I looked at this puzzle for a few minutes, then I used stockfish and it was so ez."
kongburrito,That sounds like a nightmare. Where can I play?
kongburrito,Butthurt about a meme being spread.
kongburrito,Go check out some of the light houses? Walk along the old port. Check out the art museum. Buy a board game
[deleted],[deleted]
kongburrito,Go down like a hero.
kongburrito,Just do it! What's the worst that can happen!
kongburrito,"Have you looked at finding a meat market rather than going to a typical grocery store? I know there are BBQ joints that can send you smoked brisket frozen, but I don't know about uncooked."
kongburrito,"Servers are dead now, so probably not?"
kongburrito,"Meh, not much on here I don't say to people in real life.

Although I dont tell everyone in real life about tinder and anxiety, but it doesn't hurt if they know."
kongburrito,Congratulations to JSTN for being rookie of the year.
kongburrito,Get some confidence! Even if it was an accident you can use it as an ice breaker! :)
kongburrito,the feeling.
kongburrito,Keep up the hard work! Great job!
kongburrito,"Nice job! Keep up the hard work, way to juggle your obligations."
kongburrito,"Congrats on the weight loss. It's not about being perfect, it's about being better! Keep up the hard work pushing into the new year."
kongburrito,Congrats on stepping out of your comfort zone!
kongburrito,Here's to another go around!
kongburrito,"I needed to start a new hobby to better myself after me and my long term relationship parted ways. I started indoor rock climbing at the beginning of last summer. At first I was starting 5.5's, and I've managed to send a few 5.12's in my gym now. I know ratings from gym to gym can vary a lot, but I'm really happy with the progress I've made. I'm looking forward to improving more in the winter and excited to get outside in the spring :)"
kongburrito,"They really aren't, they're just unique. I've got a lot of time logged and I think the controls are really fitting for the game"
kongburrito,That's true that they aren't required! I had a good time on IX before I learned anything about the map! I was aiming to try to unlock some of the zombies trophies and to make progress on any of them I have to watch an instructional video. Compared to something like Blackout or Multiplayer where I can figure most trophies or unlocks out with a short one sentence guide. To each their own.
kongburrito,"It just really raises the floor of knowledge needed to have an enjoyment of the mode. I'm not really into reading into it, so maybe I'm at fault but I just don't enjoy it."
kongburrito,"Ghost her and get off that account. If you want an older woman change your age range. There might be older women who want a younger guy. But you lied a hell of a lot, and that's not going to lead to anything functioning."
kongburrito,"As a newer player to Zombies, I feel it has a really bad job of explaining the quests. I have to find a veteran player to get the idea a lot of the time."
kongburrito,"Now that all the DLC is free, they are locked behind challenges and levels. I think you have to get to echelon 7-8 to finish it. That being said, you don't lose any upgrades when resetting echelon, the levels stay at a static 5k per level, and depending on the game mode you can very easily hit 1.5 levels a game. I think I had one game where I got  3 Levels (maybe on double exp?) 

While it is a little grind, it is a lot of fun and the game doesn't push to make it feel grindy, if that makes sense."
kongburrito,"Just a note, the DLC is all 100% free, and while it isn't needed for the platinum, the multiplayer is pretty fun to do! A pretty long multiplayer grind, but I really enjoyed it!"
kongburrito,God. I'm like physically cringing. Can you imagine calling women sex robots but still recognizing that sex robots are repulsed by your behaviour. Whew I can't fucking even.
kongburrito,Yeah but is that what foid is short for?
kongburrito,Femoid?
kongburrito,You should definitely add to your bio and pictures before the noob boost wears off
kongburrito,"The servers were shut down a long time ago, but I think you can still adhoc a lot of the multiplayer trophies. That being said, I don't think it Is doable now.
Op is on ps3- and the servers are still up"
kongburrito,I got this plat on vita. There's definitely some skill based trophies but you really don't have to be great at the game to complete it
kongburrito,Cool me too
kongburrito,"Nice work this year. Two more trophies for me and I'll hit 1500 with 37 plats. Interestingly enough, I didn't earn any plats in Feb, March, April, September, October, or November. I think my worst month was October, with only 10 trophies earned, and November is a close second with only 12!
"
kongburrito,Doesn't buying gold Prioritize you on the stack?
kongburrito,Wrap it before you tap it. 
kongburrito,"Say when you pre-order the swipe right on her you were expecting to get the Snapchat handle DLC, but the bonus content has yet to be unlocked.

Or just ask if she wants to trade in her old relationship for the newer model :P"
kongburrito,"Not exclusive, but she made it clear that's what she was looking for in the long run and it's kind of where I want it to head."
kongburrito,"I live in a smaller city, and I've hit the end of the stack, with a few hundred matches.

I went on two dates earlier this week with one girl who I really enjoyed the time with, who we'll call K. As I was setting up a date with another girl from Tinder, I notice from FB/IG that K's roommate and this girl are pretty good friends (lots of photos together etc etc). Is this a reason to abort? I don't really want to ruin chances with K because I go to see this other gal.

edit: Thanks for the advice guys. I'm going to only move forward with K (she actually set up our next dates!). Going to let the other girl know I'm not planning to have a date. "
kongburrito,My first Platinum was Katamari Forever and I decided to go for it because it was my favorite game at the time interestingly enough it's one of the few games I still go back to after I platinumed it still
kongburrito,A lot of people put tags that rep where they are from. Back in the BO days my tag was the area code of my city. It's sometimes fun to see other players with your tag or even a code from another city.
kongburrito,Focus on improving yourself. You're not unattractive. The way you bring yourself down is not helping you and it's a vicious cycle. 
kongburrito,He has the same pity party here every week and won't listen to any feedback or constructive criticism. It's not worth it.
kongburrito,"Ah, less than a second on the clock would do it!"
kongburrito,"That rook on g5 seems to be doing nothing, seems odd he wouldn't get it in a position that prevents the promotion. "
kongburrito,"I'm always bad at these puzzles, but isn't moving the pawn to e1 and promoting to a queen mate?"
kongburrito,"I'm really happy to hear it. There's not a lot of games that scratch the collection itch, but this one does it so well"
kongburrito,I'll keep this in mind. Part of my hesitancy to go for it is because I really don't want to be disrespectful to her and her space I guess. Thanks :)
kongburrito,"congratulations. This is my very first platinum trophy so many years ago, and it's a game I still come back to very often :)"
kongburrito,And you never paid for drugs Dewey!
kongburrito,Thanks a lot! 
kongburrito,I'd do it for 5 million.
kongburrito,I get what you're saying but in the moment I just can't read the body language. Thanks for the advice :)
kongburrito,"The positive signs were there for sure, and the physical barrier was broken, but I didn't go for it when I dropped her off. "
kongburrito,"I just got back into tinder maybe two weeks ago. Met up for a second date last night with a girl I met Sunday. Planning for just a short date because we both had plans, but we ended up just sitting and talking for hours past where I thought we'd leave off. I ditched my plans, and I am unsure if her plans fell through or if she established them early as an out just in case. She's got an amazing sense of humor, and I just super genuinely enjoyed the time! It's really a breath of fresh air to click with someone like this.

My question for y'all: I just really don't like initiating a first kiss because if they're not ready, I think it comes off as really assertive. Just not the kind of guy I am. I have a really hard time reading body language and knowing if that's what they want/are expecting. I feel like an idiot for asking, but what am I supposed to be looking for? What are the signs?
 
She says she peruses this sub so I am trying to stay intentionally vague. "
kongburrito,How many games of blackout did you burn through to get all the specialists/skins?
kongburrito,"You were indeed the other one!
The game still has a few core players, but my group ended up having to boost everything. "
kongburrito,I've been speaking Korean ever since my start as the king of all anime seventeen years ago.
kongburrito,"Hannah Montana for number 100 or bust!

But for real, what games are you thinking of going for?"
kongburrito,"It has to be said, you can enjoy a bad game for trophies, but you have to recognize that the fun comes from the hunt sometimes and not from the game."
kongburrito,That's how i plan to be the best. Ill just train on stock fish until I can beat every level 
kongburrito,Why not articulate the problem than giving a gay inaccurate buzzword comment?
kongburrito,How long is he looking for a room and what time range?
kongburrito,On the pc version I recall it being two cycles instead of three that it was on the first patch when I played this game.
kongburrito,Did they ease up the difficulty on the last level?
kongburrito,"No access to facebook, what's the date?"
kongburrito,It's also worth noting the theater mode for the game doesn't work either.
kongburrito,"If only my hamster ball had a USB plug in, it be perfect."
kongburrito,"I really like Infamous 2, I also really enjoyed the Batman games. I think they both start with tutorials, but that is kind of all over the place. 

Co-op games on console are tricky. I find that the games that work best with someone who is less familiar with games are games with simple controls/objectives. A game like Overcooked is nice (although it is ps4 only) as there are only two-three buttons and one stick. The LEGO games are nice because their controls are generally pretty simple as well. I would suggest avoiding first person games to begin with, I find the spacial awareness isn't always there for someone who just started playing games. All this being said, the PS3 has been out a long time so theres a lot of great lists online for good co-op ps3 games!

Journey has a lack of conflict, but it also doesn't provide a lot of direction. My ex tried playing it and began to get demotivated when she couldn't find the next place to go.

You can have a second controller on a PS3 without tying it to an account. It has been a while since I played my PS3, but I think even with online play you can have player 1 be username(1) and player 2 be username(2) in online games."
kongburrito,"Dodged a bullet if anything.
If she isn't willing to hear you out here you were bound to get into it over something else."
kongburrito,"Quick response, you're really banking time for the end game"
kongburrito,You premoved that title....
kongburrito,Just message her!
kongburrito,Ooh Stax! Weird catching you in a different sub reddit for once.
kongburrito,Do you offer these anywhere? I'd love one as a Christmas present :)
kongburrito,Throw the picture of you and the dog first. It's like putting tinder on easy mode
kongburrito,"Yeah, my guess is you fucking radiate your opinions. If you're not getting matches there's a reason. Lucky for them."
kongburrito,Maybe she didn't like that I liked getting high...
kongburrito,I've never physically hurt from reading something until now.
kongburrito,"Buy Plus, purchase every game in the playstation store, at a sick discount of course. Profit 30$ a year. 

Why aren't more people doing this!"
kongburrito,"""If u arent alex honnold swipe left""

I've never heard the expression wredtle pebbles. Love it"
kongburrito,I have a breakfast taco cook book but man nothing beats  a bacon egg cheese potato from torchies
kongburrito,A quick context for those out of the loop. The current meme in the 2007scape reddit is to lock a strong PvP spell behind a task. It started with changing the sizes of icons and it's gotten crazier and crazier.
kongburrito,Good opinion with a flawless defence
kongburrito,Zombie easter egss feel like a chore and not an objective. I've always felt that zombies has too little guidance for a new player to understand the objectives of maps without a guide or senior player. Extinction felt like you could get through the map because the objectives were apparent. Definitely one of my favorite call of duty modes.
kongburrito,Normally it's a good thing! I've had a couple girls interested. But yeah I'll take climbing over a girl.
kongburrito,Yeah. I live in a semi rural area so I don't have an unlimited number of matches that are attractive/message back. Hate to lose one but also dodged a bullet
kongburrito,"Talking with a girl for a bit, she asks about my hobbies. I mention I like to rock climb and play video games. She goes ""Rock climbing, seriously?"" And then is clearly done with our conversation. It fizzles a bit and then died. 

I've seen bios that say ""If you play video games you need to swipe left,"" but I guess I've never seen someone react like that to a physical activity.... Not irked its just a little funny to me."
kongburrito,I feel like this conversation would have happened the same way no matter how you responded to him...
kongburrito,Did you watch any of the games?
kongburrito,You didn't predict an excuse if I used it as a response? But take what you can get I guess.
kongburrito,"I'm a very low rated player. Even I saw that move.... (when I looked at sesse, I'm a grandmaster now.)"
kongburrito,"I'll stay hydrated whenever I want. My goal, your goal, whatever. It's a few seconds. If I'm not thirsty I'll skip. Tough shit kiddo."
kongburrito,This makes me happy :)
kongburrito,If you pay me I'll throw the game. I'm all in for a little collusion
kongburrito,"I like your suggestions but I think you missed a big thing.

Look, I get it. When chess was invented, turn based games were the shit. In the late 90's, final fantasy 7 was the shit. But it's 2018 now baby, were on like Final Fantasy 15. No more turn based structure, it's a relic of the past. Players should be allowed to make as many moves as they want as fast as they can. Players that want to stay on this old turn based combat system can wait for Chess Remastered. If chess was such a good game, why wasn't there a sequel?"
kongburrito,What country are you in? If you're willing to ship in US let me know. I'd be happy to just buy it/pay for shipping.
kongburrito,Who hurt you?
kongburrito,This feels like a Seinfeld episode
kongburrito,Does that include the Armageddon game if it gets to that?
kongburrito,I believe I finished at Tier 160. My last item was a White Supernova!
kongburrito,I dont know if we can trust this sort of hear-say.....
kongburrito,You automatically vote on your comments when you post them
kongburrito,"And he's stunning to. Really nice to have the three best looking chess players on one stream. Also I hear they're pretty good.
/s"
kongburrito,Is this loss? I like the reference on the lack of understanding of memes on the Chess24 stream. Fun banter!
kongburrito,"Sorry, just hopping into this game, which move was this?"
kongburrito,"if all twelve games of the classical time controls go to a draw or each player nets the same number of wins, they go to accelerated time controls. Most people here say that Magnus is favored in the faster time controls."
kongburrito,Have to balance strength and endurance though. I find that rock climbing doesn't offer the best cardio unless I do laps on a few top rope routes.
kongburrito,"That unfortunate. I really like the pace of her analysis. Sometimes she catches things and explains why a move isn't ""a great move"" when a bad player like myself would fall for it."
kongburrito,"This is still in the opening. You've seen players blunder 1.5 advantages before, it can happen again."
kongburrito,Bone in at B dubs sucks though.
kongburrito,"I think it's better to put the question in the text of the post with a spoiler free title.

That being said, this title doesn't really spoil anything. I'm about halfway through the first read of the book, I don't think this ruined anything"
kongburrito,"5 hours a day is not fucking attainable if you have a normal job and social life. If I go to work at 7, get off at 4, and lets say I remove commutes because I work from home. That's playing til 9 fucking PM. Don't try to call that reasonable."
kongburrito,Me own goaling when I'm up by 2 at 0 seconds is half of the game.
kongburrito,"This isn't how that works on PS4.... If you own a game on account A, account A can play it on any PS4 that it is logged in on. For other accounts to have the ability to play the game account A owns, account A must be activate that system as it's primary system."
kongburrito,"The problem is at the end of the day, you have to get a drink. Saying ""I want coke and nothing else"" implies you don't care if I give you Pepsi or a shit smoothie if there's not going to be coke. 

Ranked choice voting lets you say ""I want a coke, if you don't have that and I have to choose between Pepsi and a shit smoothie, ill take the former"" (or the latter, I don't know your personal tastes.)"

kongburrito,I think what we really need is a bridge.....
kongburrito,I don't get your point here so I'm done. Have a good one
kongburrito,"I'll be there most likely

I cant tell you what ill be wearing. Hopefully something cloth like..."
kongburrito,"Your extrapolating his opinion so hard. He's working in the present, because the past can't be changed only learned from."
kongburrito,"Kind of random to bring that one up? Both sides do it, it isn't okay when either side does it.
"
kongburrito,"Yeah, it's definitely tougher. It is my first cod since black ops 2. I remember spamming grenades up here in the past to clear it out. That just isnt doable any more"
kongburrito,"Yeah, not my normal practice to hang up there, but with not every one having a grenade on spawn like previous games, you can hang up there way longer before someone catches the drift. "
kongburrito,I am bad
kongburrito,My best game was camping up here :(
kongburrito,"Not op but I really think Rizzo has a better consistency than Jknaps. This hasnt always been the case but last season really cemented this for me. 
Rizzo seems to always perform great at LAN events too."
kongburrito,A year is a lot when you're talking about a game out for three years. Think about all the new mechanics from a year ago that are staples in top level game play now.
kongburrito,It's okay! Your English is probably better than my German :)
kongburrito,"Add me at dgaustin, I'd love to try to coran up extinction dlc. I havent played in a while so you'll have to forgive me while I get up to speed! I'm usa east coast time, lets try to figure out a time that works for us!"
kongburrito,In all time control games both players have that win condition though. But I do see your point!
kongburrito,"Yeah i've read this as well. It just seems like having that extra win condition at such a high level is very helpful. I know such a fast time control is very different but with the past three games ending in draws it has me asking ""what if..."""
kongburrito,"I'm new to chess and I just looked up armageddon time controls. It says that a draw is a win for Black, and that seems like an incredible advantage!"
kongburrito,Are you on ps4? Id love to go back and do the dlc
kongburrito,Do you live inside of a server?
kongburrito,"I'm level 3 or 14 on Black Ops 4. I got a 28 K/D on a Hardcore game by camping the tower on Firing Range. 

I'm not a good player. I'm certainly not a cheater. Just a decent game and the right situation. 

In Black Ops 1/2 this sort of thing was prevented so well by just throwing a frag up there on respawn. Now it feels like there's so little most specialists can do."
kongburrito,"Dude get rid of the time stamp.
What a low move"
kongburrito,I almost was going to correct you saying that they didn't take Dignitas to game five then I remembered that we live in a different reality
kongburrito,"I only saw one, but yeah. VP had great defense but he just couldn't secure a goal. 

I feel like in other series every dignitas hit is towards another dignitad player or a save, and here they were just smacking the ball."
kongburrito,This aged quickly
kongburrito,If you watched the rest of the weekend I think you would have seen the competitor that dig is. C9 stopped because they were playing out of their minds good and threw dignitas off from the get go
kongburrito,Panda was missing a lot od shots but I was really baffled by Turbo. Uncharacteristicly missing clears to relieve pressure
kongburrito,You guys are nuts.
kongburrito,I love the energy Klassux has when he wins
kongburrito,Especially after playing in so many matches yesterday. /s
kongburrito,What a bunch of fucking losers booing a team. Grow up.
kongburrito,Makes the time fly by and let's you know more about the players!
kongburrito,I can't unsee this
kongburrito,"You're in the Maine subreddit, it is a pretty reasonable assumption that you're in the Eastern timezone."
kongburrito,"Lots of people pay for cosmetic items in a lot of games. Who gives a fuck how other people spend their money? As long as it remains cosmetic it isn't hurting any other players, it doesn't give a competitive advantage."
kongburrito,I want the Score from Capping A and with 4 or 5 people it takes a fraction of a second.
kongburrito,"Hoping my Pinkies make it in this year! Some fierce competitors , they just need to get their time to shine."
kongburrito,Now his followers are crying....
kongburrito,What a fucking awful simile
kongburrito,"Roundabout is pretty fun! Happy to see some more people get to play this game for the first time.

Burly Men at Sea may not be everyones cup of tea, but it's a fun little VN-ish style game, and its only about two or three hours for the entire story line. Still cute and I love the audio through the game."
kongburrito,I know you're memeing but what is my scamming only Ironman supposed to do now.....
kongburrito,I really wish the sound quality was better. Or maybe its the audio balancing?
kongburrito,I'm not OP but I don't follow any social media. So I didn't know Boston was cancelled until today....
kongburrito,We're the mystery team!!
kongburrito,"My first choice was out round one, but my second choice got second place! I'll take that little victory :)"
kongburrito,"If they stopped playing, and they have no intention to play in a recoverable situation, they can take the ban for leaving early. I don't support unsportsmanlike conduct.

Also no need to get vulgar with me dude. We're talking about car soccer here. "
kongburrito,Because I don't believe in feeding that sort of behavior. I'll give up when I consider the game a loss. Being down a goal is just that. One goal. If I refuted the idea of ever coming back from a game I wouldn't be the rank that I am. 
kongburrito,Because I'll ff if I'm down three with a minute left n I don't give up two minutes into a game down by one
kongburrito,I can't wait to be bumped by my teammates all game because they can't trash talk and I wont FF
kongburrito,"I found that when I started, the first few times I went I was knocked out by just a handful of wall climbs. If your gym offers auto belays I suggest trying to do some laps on an easier climb to build up some endurance. For me increasing the time I spent at the gym was a matter of time to build up that endurance.
 
Just like every other exercise, it's very important to stretch before you climb too. Make sure you're getting warm and giving yourself rest when you are on the wall. If you're a relatively new climber, focus on your form and ask a more experienced climber if you have any places where you're wasting energy."
kongburrito,How long have you been climbing for?
kongburrito,What is the point of this comment.
kongburrito,"I love this game. I watch almost every game on the weekends.

But living across the country I can't get a reasonable plane ticket a month in advance... It can't be any better living abroad."
kongburrito,Any suggestions? I don't know what resources are out there
kongburrito,"Ah, this makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the great insight!"
kongburrito,"Ugh I commented saying that Scrub was forgotten and then I was reminded he didn't make it to LAN.....

That one hurts :("
[deleted],[deleted]
kongburrito,"Having the league play be a LAN is not going to fix this. Removing the opportunity for talent to compete is not going to fix this. I don't know the solution, but increasing the barrier to entry and removing half of the present talent won't fix anything.

I'm entertained by RLCS. I personally like the desk. I get that it isnt everyones cup of tea but thats fine."
kongburrito,"""Deevo, Bluey, Scrub, Squishy, Chausette, JSTN, Gimmick and many more would be out of RLCS.""

These are some of the best players in the league and the game. I'm not saying there aren't good rookies but I prefer to watch the cream of the crop. Asking for other players to take their place implies bringing in worse players. You can't replace half the players and not about you won't lose some talent"
kongburrito,I wouldn't watch worse players play every week just because it was a LAN format.
kongburrito,Check my time stamps for the NA ps4 version! If you select the right settings you can make it so the events are possible to fail very quickly
kongburrito,I believe those are the gills that he is referring too.
kongburrito,"I have to follow everyone else and suggest Revival. I really enjoyed it.

I'd also suggest checking out both The Long Walk and The Running Man. Both are very short but very enjoyable!"
kongburrito,"It took me 14hrs, 25min to complete everything.

Cops and robbers takes about 20 minutes, Bikes takes about 2-3 hours, Cagney update takes maybe 20 minutes if you push through quickly, party pack takes 30 minutes if you're quick, but no more than an hour. Legendary cars, boost, and toy cars is easy and fast. Big Surf island takes about 2-3 hours to burn through. I got through it in about an hour on my run, but I had done it very recently and knew the method to speed through it.

I also got pretty lucky and had a friend willing to go through the island and timed challenges quickly with me,"
kongburrito,"Oh man. When I saw under 14 hours, I thought you beat my record for 100% time. Nice speed for the plat though!"
kongburrito,And likely all in the same thread
kongburrito,Because it's bad or good? Early Modern English Grammar knowledgeless here.
kongburrito,This always bothered the heck out of me. I have the same chess set... Why is luigi the queen. If only there was a princess they could use....
kongburrito,"No problem man, literacy is hard"
kongburrito,He's talking about last season.
kongburrito,"A lot of them don't claim to be individuals. But it's the way he insists that he is ""a solo player"" consistently and the way he shit talks everyone who rightfully doubts him that makes me speak out against him more."
kongburrito,"I don't want to say they aren't, but I am saying first hand that I know he has had multiple players. "
kongburrito,Hakoom has had other players play on his account before.
kongburrito,"For younger kids, anything involving color is really helpful. The concept of choice in cards and random isn't really there, but something like a color changing Handkerchief would be perfect."
kongburrito,"I think the new UI is nice, being able to save a percentage for larvae usage while limiting the empowering on territory units is nice.

However, it is really hard to select the percentages in the top of the unit. I'd rather have the larger selection and make it more often personally."
kongburrito,I think he meant the counting to six part.
kongburrito,"Man, this is a nickname I could get behind."
kongburrito,"I'd prefer to see things that reward normal play rather than asking players to go for a nutty play. 

I'd be unhappy if my teammate went for a turtle goal for the equalizer at 0 seconds on an open net and let the ball drop because of it."
kongburrito,I like the current demo. Smoke screening is a strategy honestly and I hope they don't take that away from us by changing goal explosions. Having more clarity in a goal explosion would change how the game plays. 
kongburrito,"This sub may not be the best place to complete this. I would suggest creating a boosting session on psnprofiles.com
"
kongburrito,Who do you think the best player in RLCS is and why is it Joro?
kongburrito,"So should all trophies that are easily obtained be regarded to everyone?  I get your point but I'd you didn't complete the requirement you shouldn't get the trophy or platinum. It's unfortunate that this trophy is specifically time Based, but that's the nature of the beast. Should have started it longer ago"
kongburrito,Sidebar of the Sub as Cloud 9 as 5-0 and FQ as 0-5. Someone updated it a bit premature.
kongburrito,That's the trade off of playing games nearly a decade after they are release I suppose
kongburrito,It devalues it for those that did everything though
kongburrito,Psn is dgaustin. Currently champ in twos and threes
kongburrito,that happens at grand champ level? Or are you lower ranked in SS?
kongburrito,"If you're actually bronze 3, I understand this feeling. The feeling of controls while you're on ball cam take getting used to,

The issue with your proposed control scheme is, in faster paced games, if your controls moved with the camera you would have to be constantly shifting your hands to turn right or left. Right now, to turn right, I hold right on the control stick. That's far more intuitive that holding down if the camera is facing to my right or left side."
kongburrito,"The items needed in this game to fulfill orders are randomly generated. The characters asking for the items are from a fixed pool, and they have a few things they can say.

In this case, the basketball player is asking for items that ""represent the players on the court."" The order is for 24 cotton."
kongburrito,"Is anything else in this game ""consumed til log out."" that's a really dumb method. If I'm bank standing and want a purple pheonix, I shouldn't be punished if I idle for a minute or go to the bathroom."
kongburrito,"I'm asking if you want to play dropshot I guess. psn is dgaustin
"
kongburrito,I'm looking for people to play Dropshot with in this skill level. I'm c1 last season.
kongburrito,Dreams come true :)
kongburrito,"I agree, the patter in this routine was amazing. I really enjoyed the routine due to it."
kongburrito,Does 16 tasks mean that you require players to spend T-Cash to get additional tasks? or do later leagues allow more tasks?
kongburrito,"Best car in the game without a doubt.

kongburrito,"As a Gizmo main with about 2k wins, you have to be the change you want to see in the world."
kongburrito,A lot of variations of card to impossible place could be interesting.
kongburrito,"I was level 110 on the new update. can I expect m rank to be bumped up also? I'm certainly not the oldest rocketeer but I've been here for a a year and seeing the 110 really is a punch to the gut, especially with how fast the levels are."
kongburrito,Is there a level requirement? I just unlocked the co-op but am interested in joining one.
kongburrito,"I've been playing with these guys for years now, so the trust was definitely earned among all of us! "
kongburrito,"I have around a 50 trophy level. I don't even think my collection is this big! Obviously I wouldnt mind having this at some point. :)

I can't speak for all trophy hunters, but I game share a lot of games. I probably only buy about a quarter of my games. I'm in a small friend group and we mail around games to save some money."
kongburrito,"Oh awesome. I talk down to that discord because it was very elitist. They banned some people for BS reasons, and they talked down to people with lower plats."
kongburrito,Is this the discord theYuriG moderates on?
kongburrito,"Yeah, I find those are a lot better, the written ones can be major poopoo"
kongburrito,Some of the wiki guides are not great. I remember the natures spirit being bad

kongburrito,I think you're on the wrong side of the bell curve to be considered lucky
kongburrito,Yes you can for this game
kongburrito,Hifi the puff player?
kongburrito,Hifi the highly puff player?
kongburrito,"I think there's a number of factors that go into a control scheme being clunky. 

Think to Mass Effect 3. There is a button that you use to run, roll, open doors, interact with items, cover, leave cover, vault over cover, etc.... I found this control to be hard to use from time to time.

Look at a game like Street Fighter 5. In a series where inputs previously felt crisp and quick, the slight input delay makes the game feel ""clunky."" This isn't because the control scheme is bad, but the control scheme no longer feels responsive.

I think the easiest way for me to grasp clunky controls is to think about the difficulty of the game. (With the exception of games where clunky controls are the selling point.) Are you finding the game difficult because the content is hard or are you finding the game difficult because the controls are difficult. "
kongburrito,What is the game between midnight and mayo?
kongburrito,"There was a mode blurred on the main menu with single player, multiplayer, and so on. The only thing we could see is that it is a green icon."

kongburrito,Thanks
kongburrito,What items do you get out of c wars that people idle for
kongburrito,"Most of these games have a 100% guide depicting how to do it, which options to pick, when to make saves. It's a bit like a point and click game, but with a lot more shame."
kongburrito,Oh I've never had money so that explains why I don't know this. Thanks :)
kongburrito,Why would it not let him drop the D chain?
kongburrito,"I took the mailboat last weekend! It was probably 3-4 hours, and really its just riding the boat around the Bay. If you're into that, you'll enjoy it. If you'd rather hop off the boat and explore, take the fairy to Peak's island and rent a bike!

I really like Duckfat so maybe I'm in a minority here. It is generally very crowded but I think the food is good for the price.

Holy Donut is also worth it in my opinion. The donuts are unique, very heavy but good! I've never seen it without a line, but generally it moves quick enough.

If you are thinking about making your way down to Scarborough, I really suggest checking out Nonesuch Brewery!"
kongburrito,"I went to Slab once and was really not into it. I thought the pizza was average at best, and the lack of options was disappointing. "
kongburrito,"Sorry to hear you got caught choking the chicken. Unfortunately, you really shouldn't post someones personal information. 

Good luck."
kongburrito,"I was going to come in to say Magus. Its by far the worst, semi functioning game on PS3"

Happy cake to you too"

kongburrito,Try deleting the save data and restarting.
kongburrito,Say goodbye to that stacked bank account buddy! 
kongburrito,"I played through it with a friend, so it became a game to make fun of the game. Only way to really enjoy it.

I don't remember there being four enemy types. That's atleast four times as many enemies as I remember :)"
kongburrito,"My favorite part of this game is there is a cutscene where they show a giant robot in the distance. 

As other games have trained me for, I was prepared to get into a boss battle, which for a game this dull, sounded very exciting.

Immediately the game cuts to another cutscene of the robot dead. No boss, no explanation. Back to killing T-X000's for you. What a disappointment."
kongburrito,"I just hit 99.42%

I've been on the grind but I feel like once you are at the max size its nearly impossible to see the small items you are missing."

kongburrito,"I don't think we've ever seen a free Assassin's Creed game (I'm sure someone can correct me on this)

My guess is no, but if we do I'd be pleasantly surprised."
kongburrito,"I really enjoy all the Ratchet and Clank games, with the first one being the only one I couldn't recommend for trophies. :)"
kongburrito,I've burned through a couple PS3's and I recommend the slip. The super slim disc tray is less than desirable and I think that the fatty has little over the slim. Refurbished you'll likely find a slim anyways.
kongburrito,I completed the ps4 version with very little difficulty. I think the vame is a 6/10. Hard mode is difficult but doable and the platinum challenges just take a few tries.
kongburrito,A shot where whiskey is chased by a shot of pickle juice/brine
kongburrito,I think the puzzles have a low difficulty cap but there's some nice methodologies for solving the larger puzzles that I find very enjoyable
kongburrito,I've completed all the picma games too! Actually the reason I jumped on pic a pix :)
kongburrito,"Pic-A-Pix was going to be my recommendation. It's a solid puzzle game, and I think all the puzzles can be solved 100% logically, no guess work needed. I would love more levels or a photo creator!"

kongburrito,"Out of curiosity, is there any reason it is a 30 man bracket with single elimination as opposed to 32 (a round number with no byes) and a double elimination bracket (which allows more players to play more games) which is very nice especially with Challonge."
kongburrito,Great question. If I thought of the chickens as pets I'd be very concerned. But they just sort of hang out and I guess they haven't had any issues. Or none that I know of.
kongburrito,"This is my favorite answer. We have chickens that hang out on our property. We don't really lock them up at night, they just seem to like hanging out around our place. I haven't had an issue with a tick yet on my property."

kongburrito,"I just hit 200, I made it a milestone of a game I did with friends, rather than a game I thought was hard. I think you need to figure out if you want it to be an iconic game, a hard game, a meme game, a game with friends, and then choose accordingly.

kongburrito,So the date went well I assume.

I just feel like this has given me more confidence to approach people. I know tinder isnt the same ball game as other places, but I feel like I'm missing shots I dont take.

/rant"
kongburrito,"I'll speak to this game. Probably one of the more enjoyable fps rogue likes. The game does a good job of keeping playthroughs fresh with new weapons and level up rewards as you progress. Rooms are randomly generated, but you can learn the room layouts. Difficulty choice lets you decide whether you want a wall in the park or a nail biting experience.

Plus theres a good number of challenges and character choices"
kongburrito,"If you make a lobby at peak times, like evenings and weekends you can probably find people. There's people in this thread looking to helo too!"
kongburrito,"You have to complete fifteen co op missions. Also, to get to the lowest sentence you need, its easiest and fastest to grind a multiplayer mission"
kongburrito,I got the plat recently. I didnt think it was too hard.
kongburrito,"Odd thing happened. Got another reward, seemed to be lagged a bit. Opened the game again after a system restart and all three items popped at once. Very odd"
kongburrito,"ITs from the right thing, I've received whispers with rewards from it before. Is there any way to see most recent items, or sort to limit to rlcs items?"
kongburrito,"Yeah they are official, restarting isn't doing it"
kongburrito,I've gotten a few whispers for rewards but am not seeing them in game.Anyone have this issue? Or maybe they aren't popping up but I don't know what i gotr
kongburrito,CLG isnt looking pretty. Nice to know ghost is going 2-5
kongburrito,Its crazy how awful it is. They lose a lot and they don't cover when they lose
kongburrito,"When's nrg playing.
Gg"
kongburrito,"Yeah. If I got the opportunity to have a 20% coupon to use when I wanted to use it, I'd have bought a lot more games too!"
kongburrito,I can barely hear my data stream start up now over my engine. The reason I use it is because my teammates can all hear it easy...
kongburrito,Am i crazy or did the boost getyour a lot quieter. I can barely hear my data stream over my engine now.
kongburrito,"I'm slightly disappointed when they updated the gizmo. They removed the loving named ""gizmo butthole"". The Gizmo's tail end would expand and contract as you boosted. The wings are cool but I miss the old gizmo a bit. I wish we could have both. The octane gets a second model, lets see that old gizmo model."
kongburrito,"I have 2k on the gizmo.

It started as a joke. I waivered for a bit to the dominus/octane, but my Gizmo always calls me back. I actually rarely change much on my car except the wheels at this point.

2,000 wins with the gizmo, 4,000 saves with the labyrinth, 12,000 goals with the royal crown, days of boost with the datastream, and all my playtime on the beta nugget. It's a wild ride!
"
kongburrito,"Sorry this isn't a direct answer, but heavy rain was on ps4 also. Are you sure the ps now version isn't the ps4 version. They have different stacks"
kongburrito,"Yup, I think I got banned. Why? I asked why my friend was banned.

He was banned by Yuri for no reason. Everyone in the chat was mad I asked the question, so I had to go back into the chat logs"
kongburrito,"I've found that whenever it asks for me to log in with my google play account (I use a few different ones for different apps), even if I use the same account I lose the time. If I start the game in Airplane mode  (or I guess with no connection?) I lose my time.

this is all anecdotal, so I have not tested this extensively. Let me know if there's any additional information that would help.

Also the in game tip still directs to /r/slurpyderpy"
kongburrito,"Add me at dgaustin. I have two ps3 also.

I also thought the servers for this game were region locked."
kongburrito,"Thinking about it, I actually think the server closures only effect ps3 and ps4 sr3/sr4, as it had to do with the character upload trophies."
kongburrito,Saints row 4 and gat are impossible now due to server closures I thought
kongburrito,Awesome. What time zone are you? We'll try starting it this weekend 
kongburrito,"I'm interested, add me with a message"
kongburrito,"It looked like it in the video too.
I was toying around with this last night on PS3 a little bit, I'm looking to write a guide moving forward. 

Another trophy hunter said that using it to break through Jak 1 means you miss a story related trophy, so it may be a question of how we end up unlocking that."
kongburrito,"Okay? Why do you feel that way?

Edit: Made this reply a minute later and I see the accounts been suspended. Oh well."
kongburrito,"I really like Tap Tap Evolution (formerly slurpy derpy), and Realm Grinder.

Realm Grinder feels like a normal clicker to start with, but the further you get the more unlocks are received, some of which greatly change the game."
kongburrito,"I'm interested how this affects the trophy hunting community too. There was previously a glitch used for all the orbs in Jak 2, but if the debug mode can spawn them I'd be interested on how that breaks the trophies. "
kongburrito,"I think theres three or four, but they don't take over an hour or so. There are a few trophies that require multiple players iirc."
kongburrito,If it wasn't in plus I'd see it being at like 10% maybe slightly lower. I think it's sub five because of plus
kongburrito,You could do it. There's only one or two really hard trophies.
kongburrito,"I don't know the tournament, was Hugs sandbagging or something?"
kongburrito,"Fair enough. I think having the ability to autocast during a timewarp would be really nice. I think having it set up in a way similar to Realm Grinder could be very cool. I can elaborate on the system that it uses if need be.

Having it balanced out by costing RAD points could help. 1 Rad, 1 spell, +2 rad, 2 spell, +4r ad, 3 spell... etc.
That would really benefit the time warp at higher values, as it gets impossible to cast as fast as Energy is regen'd "
kongburrito,Dude that's not a thing the ike climbers were just in a p.m. video Once...
kongburrito,How'd you feel about it?I have this in my backlog and in tempted to go in
kongburrito,You've been there before? Is it generally pretty busy? Does one need a reservation?
kongburrito,"In my experience, even getting out of the coma, I spent a couple days in the hospital. That threw my schedule off enough that I had to be re-calibrated when I got out of the hospital."
kongburrito,"I was in a medically induced coma for two days, and I have no recollection of anything from those days.
 
I was put in the coma on Monday and I woke up on Wednesday. All I remember asking my friends who were with me was ""Can you guys help me study for my test tomorrow (Tuesday)"""
kongburrito,"Codes for one days aren't a thing to my knowledge.

If you buy it on a new account with a Plus Demo, you can still play it on your main account, but the new account must have that playstation activated as it's ""primary"" playstation"
kongburrito,100%.completing is possible on all difficulties
kongburrito,"But it's still fun, on both a casual ans competitive level"
kongburrito,"It's okay to be wrong.

But seriously, why are you done with Melee?"
kongburrito,You can manually add transactions if you would like.
kongburrito,Thanks! Great synopsis
kongburrito,"For those of us out of the loop, what is his current situation?"
kongburrito,"Yes, the number of moves per character is unchanged, but the mechanics are very different. Jump cancelling, wavedashing, and l cancelling are all specific to melee. Air dodges have completely different mechanics between the two games. This is why melee is seen as more combo heavy and sm4sh seen as more nuetral heavy. Ledge mechanics between the two games are also very different, as melee only one player can be on the ledge at once, while sm4sh another player can grab the ledge while someone is on it. This changes the mechanics of edge guarding greatly.

"
kongburrito,"Do you play either of these competitively?

Besides being platform fighters, they are very different gameplay wise. Saying it's the same because  of that is like saying all 2d fighters play the same 
"
kongburrito,"I don't know if this was the case in one or maybe one of the later games, but I'm pretty sure a roll's end lag can be canceled with a shoulder charge also. You can also use a special costume so I recommend using one that gives you unlimited magic."
kongburrito,"Plants Vs Zombies is perfect for this!

I also recommend freedom wars. I think the combat is a tad dull so it is pretty easy to look away for a bit while spamming attack or shoot."
kongburrito,Invite dgaustin
kongburrito,"I think you should really seek professional help. Being angry is okay, but I think that having this level of anger and the implication of suicide is not.

If you don't want to be a programmer, what would you like to be?"
kongburrito,I'd probably switch to PC. I've spent a lot on digital games and if I can't access those I don't want to be building up a backlog at that cost again.
kongburrito,Ratchet and clank trilogy is all offline
kongburrito,"If you want RPG's, I think the MARDEK series has speedrun potential.

For platformers, you can have fancy pants adventures or even an older game like Portal Flash version.

Is there a specific style of game you're interested in?"
kongburrito,"Extra credit has a couple videos specifically about each of these topics. Id also look through the GDC youtube channel, they tend to have a lot of good content."
kongburrito,"I see trophy hunting as a hobby. It's up to you how much you spend on your hobby. When I bought a new TV, I kept my old one and now I use it for my PS3 when I'm doing something like a TellTale game on my other console.

When my PS3's disc drive broke, I got a new PS3, but I still use the old one for digital download titles.

I don't think it's really a stooping down to a certain level matter."
kongburrito,"He has multiple systems and tv's. A lot of trophy hunters at that level do. 

That being said it's been admitted as a group account. I know a few guys that have done a plat for it."
kongburrito,I give you a green thumbs up.

kongburrito,"Glad you finished TTR, grats on the good month"
kongburrito,Is there any system in particular you're thinking about?
kongburrito,"I dont think tornado outbreak is that easy honestly.


I think that the community often forgets some easy games that exist too. Spare Parts on ps3 hasnt been mentioned in ages. Men in Black, Sega Genisis Collection, Jurassic the Hunted, Castles, iron cryptocle, and freeze me all come to mind."
kongburrito,I would go down that route personally. I would verify it actually has two regional trophy lists on psnprofiles before commiting though..
kongburrito,I know a lot of trophy hunters in regions with accounts in others. Ive never heard of anyone getting banned for this.
kongburrito,"I completed a stress test when I got my ICD, they pushed it from 160 to 200 because they found I could hit 160 when I did an intense work out. Hopefully you don't run into that issue again. "

kongburrito,Damn you got me gg
kongburrito,"I have an S-ICD, I don't think there are many of us in the wild."
kongburrito,Recency bias tho
kongburrito,"I can help with TTR, add me at Dgaustin.

I am USA East, so please let me know when you want to boost.

I will have to redownload it tonight, so this weekend would be a good time."
kongburrito,When I get home ill drop subs from all my google accounts.
kongburrito,Did Sharkz win over mike?
kongburrito,I was worried about it but I really enjoyed my time with the multiplayer
kongburrito,"I honestly think the multiplayer is really good. You have to ""prestige"" a lot, but when you hit level 50, you wrap back to level 1 automatically, and do not lose items or stats. Every time you prestige, you unlock the ability to complete new challenges, which accelerate leveling. After a certain point (maybe level 25), it takes 5,000 exp to level, and it never increase or decreases from there. I found myself getting 6k exp at the lowest per game, with some of my better games being nearly 20k.

The MP has a grind, but if you switch weapons often and take a look at challenges to complete for extra XP, you'll find that it doesn't take that long."
kongburrito,"The reason you got them quicker was because you did DLC at launch. When they made the DLC free, they locked some of the aesthetics (the longest one being Cyber Demon) which requires you to be in Echelon 8 to complete challenges to unlock it. If you bought the DLC, you had instant access to this armor and did not need to grind to unlock it.

"
kongburrito,"I got really burned out after Jak 2, I still haven't gone back to Jak 3. I prefer the gameplay of Jak 1 the most, but it's different strokes for different folks. "
kongburrito,"I play zelda. Falcon has to be one of the easiest match ups. He has a really hard time getting in, and she can combo him very easily. He's also very simple to edgegaurd.

Hardest is probably Marth. He can effectively wall out Zelda and his disjoint makes it very difficult to camp him. She also has an extremely hard time comboing."
kongburrito,"Rarest by Percentage is Mortal Kombat Vita

Rarest by Number is 88 Heroes

Rarest 100% (plat included) - I think it is Minecraft PS3, with a measly 0.19%  having all the trophies

Rarest 100% (PSN Game, no plat) - Joe Danger 2"
kongburrito,"I think you have the best advice tucked in here a little bit.

Watching yourself play is one of the biggest things you can do to improve.

What did you do in a situation right before you were scored on? Did you put your teammate in the back after taking all the boost? Did you go up for an aerial and miss? Did you hesitate too much to challenge the ball?

Watch a game from your teammates perspective. In a situation where he has control of the ball, where are you? Did you dive in for a hit? Where you in a good position in his view for a pass? Where you sitting in net doing turtle 360's?

I'd really recommend watching one game from your play a day. Not a game where you sweep or were swept, but a game where when the buzzer hit you go ""man we we're lucky to win that."" It's one of the best ways to improve.

"
kongburrito,I think part of the game is being aware of your teammates boost and whereabouts.
kongburrito,"Hi. Im a champ level player. I have also helped about 15 people get every trophy.

Hit me up on reddit or psn.

Sorry for spelling errors, slightly drunk"
kongburrito,Coffin dodgers is way worse but way shorter

kongburrito,"I'm really shooting for number 200 before the end of January, so hopefully we can snap shot it at 196 :)"
kongburrito,That is so cool man! Thanks a lot :)
kongburrito,"If you did mine that be awesome! Psn is dgaustin
"
kongburrito,"Thanks for calling this out, I was just telling my girlfriend I wanted to play this game if it goes on sale :)"
kongburrito,"I have played both the first and second Riptide Games, playing them to completion (I have plats in both). I actually really like them. I think that Renegade fixed all the problems of the first one. It poses an overall low difficulty, but there are some levels that can give an issue. I think the racing is pretty smooth and the gameplay is fun enough. I think if the game is under 10 bucks, you're probably going to feel you got your moneys worth.

But I'm also a schmuck. Look up some gameplay and decide for yourself :) "
kongburrito,"He's in my clan, this really happened."
kongburrito,Thanks. I was on mobile and couldnt easily link
kongburrito,"Nominating Wizzrobe vs Armada at summit 5.
Crazy good play from both players in a very close set"
kongburrito,"For most games, yes you do. A years subscription to PS+, which gives you online play, will run you 40-50 USD"
kongburrito,"Hey, 

I own this game and I am willing to help. can you let me know what the trophy is for? I can be on in about an hour and a half. "
kongburrito,You dont address that at all in the post. I think trophy saves a real slime ball move. You arent geld accountable at all if you tarnish someones account and you arent telling people the risk as it is.
kongburrito,Using save games for trophies and not earning them legit do get you banned though and arent legal on most trophy hunting sites.
kongburrito,"hm, I'm not sure what region this stack is from. Two of the three accounts are from HK so I'm not sure what store it would be in or what it is listed under..."
kongburrito,I had a feeling it was that way because I also felt like I did a lot of rounds for my trophies
kongburrito,"Ps4 or ps3 version?
"
kongburrito,"I also caught a donut, took some pictures, and then split it with the girls behind me. Exciting!"
kongburrito,"I just made it home to.Maine from this. It was a good time but man did Charolette drag on. I really liked that poppy acknowledged the little girl in tge balcony with the I love poppy sign. Crowd in such a small venue with such a niche artist cant be beat!

Also shout out to the huge russian dide at the bottom of the stairs that didnt crack a smile and stood with his arm crossed the whole time."
kongburrito,Ill be there with my girlfriend! Were both excited
kongburrito,"Oh, good call, it is just the DLC trophies that were extended. Although the DLC is all free now, just as a note for any readers! :)"
kongburrito,"Hey, I think that the Doom platinum takes a lot longer now since one of the more recent updates. you have to do a decent amount of online. It's probably an additional 10-15 hours."
kongburrito,They've played a lot of music from the Life is Strange soundtrack also.
kongburrito,Monster Jam Crush it!
kongburrito,"Good. I think I got banned from that server for calling him ""big boy""

I'd be interested in any server that does not have power happy mods."
kongburrito,Is this the server with TheYuriG as a mod?
kongburrito,Who is rhat?
kongburrito,Is this the same server that TheYuriG mods?

kongburrito,"It is against the rules of the subreddit to ask for codes.

I hope that you find a solution"
kongburrito,"Depending on how you play your first passthrough, you can super cheese the chapter select. I think I did one full passthrough and then a playing from level 6. Then one final run of the last mission for the Sam switch flick."
kongburrito,"What. 
Can someone explain?"
kongburrito,getting close to 200 platinums. What are you planning on for #200?
kongburrito,"Will you disclose your method after the tournament?
"
kongburrito,Any idea where I should look for a secondary market ticket?
kongburrito,"I really like it, though I would remove the plays column"
kongburrito,"Not entirely sure on what the hidden trophies are, and I don't think I can fix it without seeing it for myself.


Just a note for you, starting a game at all, even if you earn no trophies will add it to your last. However, under the trophy menu in the ps&amp; you can remove games that have 0% if trophies earned."
kongburrito,"You have games hidden from your profile. If you look under your banner on PSNP, on the left side of the screen there is a Blue H saying you have 100 hidden trophies.


[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVomMHwMXA8) video shows the menu you need to get to, and from there the fourth option is hidden games. You can unhide games to have them show up on PSNP"
kongburrito,"Funny enough, I've only written one guide that is still around (I was far more active in writing guides when trophies first came out, on a website that is no longer around)"
kongburrito,"I've done a few tough games for other people in return for money. I would never do it myself, but I don't really care if someone else pays me. It's their profile, if they feel its earned it for them, then so be it. "
kongburrito,"I actually wrote the Guide for 88 heroes, with the help of BeautifulTorment.

I super recommend it. There are multiple ways to really cheese the game to beat it. but over all it is a really good experience and is a blast to play normally. I believe there is also free DLC for 8 new characters, although I have not touched it (and it does not have trophies)"
kongburrito,"
Grats!

I found this plat to be extremely enjoyable, I hope others did as well."
kongburrito,14k
kongburrito,"Appreciate the advice, thank you!"
kongburrito,"Thank you, I'll look for one! :)"
kongburrito,"Fair enough, thank you for the truth on the white DS though :)
"
kongburrito,"Principal Snyder from buffy, is that you?"
kongburrito,"I appreciate it, I actually own grey. Ill take yours off your hands for a key"
kongburrito,Wait it doesnt? I feel cheated!
kongburrito,No thanks. The only non data streams I am interested in at this time are Pink Items. 
kongburrito,Hunter
kongburrito,"Okay, I will be on in about 5 and ill invite you then."
kongburrito,"No problem, I am interested. just message me at dgaustin on psn."
kongburrito,"No problem, I am interested. just message me at dgaustin on psn."
kongburrito,"I am around, still interested? shoot me a message on PSn @dgaustin"
kongburrito,"sure, sending you an invite now"
kongburrito,"Yeah man, I can be around
"
kongburrito,"I will be on soon, will you be around or should we plan fit later?"
kongburrito,Will be on in about 30min
kongburrito,I should be on then. Please just send me a message on PSN when you get on and I can hop on if not :)
kongburrito,"Okay. Do you know around what time you will be online?
"
kongburrito,Whoops. I'm done for the night but you can message me @dgaustin on psn. I'll be on at 5pm eastern
kongburrito,Pink geothermal interests me. Send me a message at dgaustin. I'm off for the night but we can trade tomorrow *5pm eastern
kongburrito,"I'll trade for both, 3k"
kongburrito,"I already have black, thank you for the offer though."
kongburrito,I already own pink and grey. Sorry.
kongburrito,"Sure, what do you have in mind?"
kongburrito,Commenting for good luck
kongburrito,"If you had a gun in the scenario od the recent shooting, how do you defend yourself from a shooter on the 32nd floor?
How is another individual,  police or civilian to know you're not the threat?"
kongburrito,D
kongburrito,Arrhythmia
kongburrito,"Infamous Second Son, call of Duty Ghost, if you aren't concerned about 100% (Lots of DLC)"
kongburrito,I answered this in a child comment. Please check if you're still curious!
kongburrito,"You can check on www.psnprofiles.com

Just go to the game you want to check, then hit 100% or platinum club. From there you can see first, most recent, and fastest achievers."
kongburrito,You register light faster than sound. Th is is why the manual timers in races use a buzzer with a flash.
kongburrito,"I'm a huge fan of this faction with Tornadoes. I love having a strong movement faction to keep my The King out longer to charge up groupie combos quicker. Being able to use an action to move minions on and off of bases the turn a base breaks allows me to burst movement onto a base even quicker, or burst attack while removing an opponents minions to win by just the right amount. 

I also personally really like steam punks in this combo also. The movement with actions that further increase groupie strength can lead to burst power of 20+ a turn, which is probably the peak for any decks."
kongburrito,Does something look wrong?
kongburrito,"Funny enough, JHZER was the flipside sub in s2. He is also a season 2 world champ."
kongburrito,Primetime should say: Choose a minion. That minion has -2 power until the end of your next turn.
kongburrito,"Sorry, but my french isn't good enough to respond back. But I'll be happy to give a shot on how I understand the question and my answers.

1. If you play the Argonaut, he simply triggers the abilities of all cards that are affected by playing an action (See Hercules or Odysseus) You could play Argonaut then Laser Sword in one turn no problem. When the argonaut comes into play, his ability is executed. If you play the argonaut as a special minion (at the time you would play an action, as opposed to a minion) you cannot play the laser sword also.

2. No, you would not be in the running for this base if you have no minions on it. You must have a minion on the base before a base scores to get Victory Points from that base, even if it is a minion of power 0. If you move a minion after a base scores, you are fine, as you have already received the victory points from that base.

3. With Unicrave (0 0 0 base), you replace the base and score using the new base and its abilities. If the base has a higher resistance than the amount of power on the base, (say it was Palooza), you would still distribute the Victory Points and discard both Palooza and Unicrave.

Hope that helps!"
kongburrito,"We also came to the point where I revealed their hand and they had multiple of the named card. We chose to discard only one if there was duplicates, but that should also be ironed out."
kongburrito,"A huge problem was hand size was never large. Perhaps if you want to keep a lot of the discard, make it discard then draw. That way your e ruining the plan but giving possibility of another."
kongburrito,"So I went ahead and did a game with this faction. I chose to use this faction with time travelers and the opposite faction has monkeys and mad scientist. I got clobbered. Any time I had a good minion or action it was removed from my hand. My best bet was to use cyberback to get all my actions but of course that was removed. Insanely good deck, need a to be dulled "
kongburrito,"I see guard as very over powered. I'd think it be better if the player did not discard the card revealed. That way if gaurd is used against you, the penalty is the other player knowing your hand, not you being unable to play. I feel like it being a common minion, you could easily shut down a player if you use it with any deck that lets you pump out multiple minions a turn"
kongburrito,"Call to arms and the minions with the same effect seem very strong. If I'm playing against aliens and I pill na invadrr out of their hand, should I really draw cards for this"
kongburrito," I'm taking Puff. 
Sing, Pound, Rest sounds like a good weekend to me. "
kongburrito,"Unnesscessary running time is insanely good. Play that on a base and leave it the whole game. If the opponent can't destroy that action, it will never go away. It's like a better version of stasis field. I see it being used where I force another player to play there with teddy bears or dragons and then not let the base break. Just so insanely good."
kongburrito,Other users are giving them away or for the shipping charge. Why are you trying to net a profit on this?
kongburrito,I really like sharks and zombies. Ponting your Tenacious Z when your opponents have no weak minions out gives a lot of additional power to hammerhead and other shark cards
kongburrito,"I had a heart complication whole at my fraternity house and died, only to be revived by a fraternity brother and MET. Whenever people hear this they often instantly assume drugs or alcohol were involved even though I'm clean as a whistle "
kongburrito,Ambiguous Teacher has the same talent as Herr Doctor but is a 2? Little too strong.
kongburrito,LoZR
kongburrito,"I've always used these cards as minions in play. I feel as if it could open up an unnecessary can of worms. The same way you can't target minions not in play for other actions, you cannot do so for these minions either."
kongburrito,"Yeah, this is normal, but at the same time your group may want to figure out your interpretation of the situation and stick with a rule.
"
kongburrito,"For the draft,  we use a randomizer to only have 12 factions on the table.  This often let's us limit the usage of these factions every game. "
kongburrito,"With draft method,  I find that generally every body gets two decks that they can play with well. For most other modes we distribute random. The draft makes your experience with the random decks important as you determine which decks should work together. "
kongburrito,"Funny, 2v2 teams draft style is our houses favourite method right now!"
kongburrito,I dislike 3s the most because the game always turns into one player being given the opportunity to pick which of the other two win.
kongburrito,"It was my first game unfortunately, so it left a really bad tast in my mouth. I'm really happy I gave the game another shot."
kongburrito,"6 Players, one player was wizards. I didn't really like it. The game moved so slow, and your interactions were almost meaningless. Planning ahead wasnt an option, so you had to do burst damage or bust."
kongburrito,Finished the list with the decks I have!
kongburrito,"Figure I'll give this a shot

* **Cease and Desist** I really like these factions. **Astroknights** feel powerful, but they don't have all the play power than many other factions have, so I feel they need a better support deck to sustain success. **Star Roamers** are easily my favorite deck in this faction. Having a near constant way to get extra minions out every turn is great. The ability to keep powerful minions in play for longer makes this deck one of my favorite support decks. I haven't played hundreds of games with them, but in the 10 or so I believe I've lost once. Personal favorite combo with them is monkeys due to their ability to stack power onto a minion, and star roamers ability to keep him in play much longer. **Changerbots** are all right, but I think there are a lot of better decks out there. They have very decent ability to push out power in a turn, but I greatly dislike the fact that they lose power for Talents, making many of their rush tactics on a base null until the end of the next players turn. (And we all know how much 1 turn can shift power on the critical base!) Finally, **Ignobles** are poop, but we enjoy them when we play draft 2v2 and they are often one of the first minions to go now!

* **It's Your Fault** After Cease and Desist, these factions push in for a quick second. I really love all the factions in this expansion. **Dragons** are a personal favorite in mine in teams, due to the ability to control bases on the board so simply, and the many ways that a teammate can help on any given play. In 1v1, they still feel very powerful, as they can so simply control which bases your opponent wants to play on, when the VP shift on a base can be so great (we often play that second place on a base gets the points for third, so the swing is generally 2-3 VP per base). **Tornadoes** feel more powerful than I would expect them to be, and I love the havoc you can make by moving other peoples minions to the worst base on the board. A favorite play I've had was moving every minion in play to Jungle Oasis, clearing the board for me and my teammate to start getting first and second on most bases. **Greeks** are a clearly powerful faction, that stand very well on their own. The balance between a few extra actions and a few extra minion plays make them very strong at keeping a decent balance of cards in your hand. Their glaring weakness is being returned to their hand, so often when they are in play in a draft, the next deck picked is a counter pick. **Sharks** make for another blast of a faction, and I really love to combo these with Zombies. The ability to ping your own minions with no risk for extra power on a base make them a threat on every turn. That leaves **Superheroes**, who while I appreciate the theme for, feel like they lack the cards to be successful. I wish that they had a better way to return cards from their discard than Golden Age. After a few turns of Mild Mannered Citizens, they have no power left to put on bases. If a hero gets pinged or destroyed, the deck is at a huge detriment. The counter play to Superheroes is much easier than other factions, as pinging MMC makes the deck stuck on every play. With that said, I give them a comfortable number 2 on my list. 

* **Science Fiction Double Feature** I reallllly like Monkeys and Shapeshifters in this expansion. **Cyborg Apes** ability to power up one minion to ridiculous levels and keep him in play for extended periods of time make them very difficult to counter play. Their ability to pump out actions and keep actions in play longer with Clyde and Cyberback make them one of my favorite factions. **Shapeshifters** are the next favorite faction in this set. Their ability to be a constant threat to your opponent by utilizing their best cards against them make them a favorite counter pick at any time. A favorite moment with this faction was while playing against explorers, Copycats were played continuously on Idaho Jones to bring double the bases into play. Silly combo, but man that was a fun game! **Super Spies** are a faction that are left unplayed often in our drafts, but I think they have a lot of potential. My only concern with them is they have a lot of things that they do at half capacity. Slight base control, slight extra actions, slight jumping a base, but all countered by too many factions. **Time Travelers** are my personal least favorite from this expansion, but we have had many games with them be extremely successful. As others have said in this thread, they have a lot of one sided match ups. It's a great support deck but they require some specific decks to keep power on them.

* **What Were We Thinking** Another blast of a set. **Rockstars** are insanely strong in smaller games, but when we bring them to a 2v2 for Free For All, it takes a long time for them to be set up. I feel they're a very well balanced faction, but I don't think they needed minions that could move around or actions that did the same. Either way, very fun faction. **Explorers** are another one of my favorite factions. Combined with Tornadoes, Star Roamers, or any other faction that can easily move minions around. You can easily rush bases and break them before any other player even gets a chance. Interesting mechanics, and I have a great time playing them. **Bears** are fun, and I think that with some choice factions, they may be up there for the most broken decks. I'd love to give Robot Bears a try, as I think the minion play and extreme power that can be gifted in one term would make them arguably the best burst decks. Last but least is the **Grandmas**. They have some amazing deck control, being able to recycle cards and force many actions and minions to their hand, forcing every turn from them to be an extreme force. 

* **Monster Smash** Alright, this has to be the worst expansion by far. There's 3 factions in it (I think were at the point where we all know **Vampires** should never be used). **Werewolves** are alright, but their theme of burst power means that ideally, you're breaking a base quickly when you play them. If no base is near breaking, I don't think they challenge very effectively. Just personal taste here. I know a lot of people like **Giant Ants** here, but they aren't quite my favorite. I think they have great minions, but I think their actions are beyond lacking. I need multiple minions out, but I seem to fail to get them out when I play. Out of the three games I've played with them, I've never gotten The Queen out, so perhaps I need to give it another shot. **Scientists** are another good faction here, but I'm just not the biggest fan. The minions feel very weak, and without Herr Doctor out, and without the Monster, I just don't think the minions are worth much. The actions are decent, with Uberserum being a highlight, but a lot of them rely on removing power counters for buffs, or discarding for buffs. There are other decks that have similar effects for far less negative effects.

To be continued...

I have yet to play with Cthulu, Munchkin, Pretty Pretty, Geeks, Awesome Level 9000. I have them all purchased but they're all sitting back home waiting for me."
kongburrito,"No worries, thanks
"
kongburrito,"I'm very interested in this offer, but I have purple ninja. Not trying to hijack the trade, OP already said no thanks."
kongburrito,"Decent offer with the FG, but I'm really not interested in the Burnt Sienna. Do you have anything else you could put on top of it?"
kongburrito,"Gotchya. Very interesting mechanics, good explanation. Very late game deck, but I feel like it could be accelerated by a non traditional deck like Ghosts."
kongburrito,"I think that Ever Growing Army seems odd. You say that it needs time to grow, but how is it different from a power 6 minion? It can drop out 6 power instantly in a turn. I would also change it to being able to grab as many as you choose, not all, so it can better control the force it has (considering it drops all of them to the discard and theres not a great option to get them back.)
I think Diabolical Scheme probably needs to be a +3 minion, I think 2's are too quick to get out with little risk. Considering it takes like, 3-4 power on a base per VP it offers.

Also there's a lot of play after a base scores. 

I'd be interested to play the deck."
kongburrito,We each draw a random basecard from the base deck and the one with the higher breakpoint goes first
kongburrito,"I love the new artwork, but I'm really interested to see how this faction plays with the combo of other factions.
"
kongburrito,"Like the idea of sharks and fairies, I'll have to try it. I've used sharks and ninjas before as the ninjas easily kill big targets while sharks help reduce a lot of the smaller ones, all while getting positive buffs."
kongburrito,"I think Super Heroes and Princesses are insanely good due to the diversity you get from Mild Manner Citizens. All your creatures are very powerful, but you have a hard time getting extra cards out any given turn."
kongburrito,I encourage you to post these threads in the future! Only way a lot of us find out!
kongburrito,For sure.  I know I wanted to speed run 88 heroes recently but the fact that there was no way to level select the level I have trouble with has turned me off completely
kongburrito,"That's totally fair. As long as that's an option. 

If your first run has infinite lives,  then you're only asking they beat every level before level select. Makes sense to me"
kongburrito,You need to have a way top repeatedly practice specific levels.  
kongburrito,"There's people with all systems there. Trophies are on all systems, most people play the modern one but a lot of us do all of them"
kongburrito,I suggest posting over in r/trophies
kongburrito,Super Sonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars

kongburrito,"I'd really recommend a Crack In Time. It was one of my earliest plats. Very very easy, and if you haven't already you'll fall in love with the franchise."
kongburrito,"Hm, alright. I own three versions and it must have been cross buy."
kongburrito,"You're not offering an investment, you're begging.
An investment is you spending money. Perhaps even by purchasing a good and or service. Such as a game?

I don't know why you're trying to call this a low IQ community. While you certainly aren't helping the average, your evidence is half assed at best."
kongburrito,Was Flower not already free?
kongburrito,"Got ya. Feels like its a big commitment to whiff, but I'm just not aware of all the options. (and I guess at some level, every whiff is too much)"
kongburrito,"It irritates me that I received a duplicate on my second pull.

That being said, if the only reason you are playing is the prize machine, maybe you need to find another game."
kongburrito,"I can help out this evening or any time tomorrow. I am US, but I'm sure our time will over lap a little bit.

Add me on PSN. My tag is dgaustin"
kongburrito,"I watched the first game of the set, so maybe you improved on this, but I felt like there was only one or two times you threw out a pill and were not punished (and those times you were offstage.)

I'm not a doc main, but how good is his dash attack? Looks like his marth was punishing your dashes frequently."
kongburrito,Because that has nothing to do with you not having rocket league. 
kongburrito,"Looks like you'll have to buy it. It goes on sale pretty frequently.

The developers took a risk and made it free to try and grab a large player base. It worked. Now the expanding player base buys the game. This is how the developer makes money.
Sometimes, developers need money so they can pay their employees. This process is called a job.
If the developer provided their product for no fee at all, they may find that they do not have the money to pay their employees. This process is called a lay off.

I know I didn't bold any text, but you may get the point."
kongburrito,"It does not need to be the primary for every account you wish to use, only the one that has the playstation plus.

If you wish to access games from any account while playing on any other account, then the account that owns the game must be the primary"
kongburrito,"I'd suggest going to a trophy hunting website or forum (more active than this sub) and using a designated boosting thread, or creating a game session on PSNProfiles. You're more likely to find other users actively playing the same games as yourself."
kongburrito,"I'd recommend if you want to earn it in Nier: Automata, read the trophy guide or roadmap if there is one available. Look for missable trophies, and focus on those if you don't want to complete additional playthroughs.

Utilize a trophy website (my personal preference being Psnprofiles.com, but there are many out there) to quickily see what trophies are missing and what goals you still have to achieve.

Finally, you can sort the trophies by rarity to see which trophies you should earlier than others in theory, or the difficulty of said trophies. 

Hopefully that helps get you started. Most important is to enjoy the journey. Don't let the trophies become a nuisance.
"
kongburrito,"There isn't a guide, do people know if this can be save exlpoited?"
kongburrito,"I would say rocket league is very obtainable, as the requirements are all very low, and it is a pretty good time as you progress to platinum.

Peggle is also available, and I do not think it is outlandishly hard either."
kongburrito,"It's. A story game. About 5 hours, as it requires 2 playthroughs. It utilizes no speech to tell it's story telling. Overall enjoyable but a little pricey if it isn't on sale"
kongburrito,"I need help. Superstar D2 in 2s, need to hit champ. PLease help?"
kongburrito,"Ah, welcome to the Game of Drones train. See you on the other side."
kongburrito,I will be home in 6 to 7 hours. If you're still free then let me know
kongburrito,"Are you interested in 5 for 20?
"
kongburrito,"As a heavy player of Katamari (and I platinumed tornado outbreak) I feel like Katamari has a lot more open routing than tornado outbreak. There is generally one route in Tornado Outbreak that welcomes you. Not saying the game doesnt have potential, I just see the ceiling being very low relative to Katamari."
kongburrito,No problem. It will take me a little time to certify an item for you but I can do it
kongburrito,"You live with findablecarpet? Does he ever practice commentary whiel you're doing something, like making a bowl of cereal?"
kongburrito,"Just to verify, are you sure you are searching in your region with a low ping?

the issue stems from Discjams usage of Peer2Peer rather than dedicated servers. If you aren't looking for players near you, you likely are getting the lag between you two"
kongburrito,"Even better, I can get you the trophy by trading a veteran certified item. In return I just ask for any junk items (duplicate or pigeons :D )
If you want to do it yourself, I'll throw you an item of your desired certification and you can just give it back when you're done."
kongburrito,"No problem. 

I can give you a heftier list when I get home, these were just the ones off the top of my head."
kongburrito,"Me and three of my friends knocked out Fuse together. We all got our plats in the same evening!

We also did Garden Warfare together. While it is not required to do together it made boosting hard challenges a tad easier.

I completed FPA with friends, as 3 people are needed for one trophy but it can support 4.

Finally, Borderlands is always a safe bet. 

"
kongburrito,"Awesome for Hax,  hoping for his success in the rest of the tournament."
kongburrito,"Pewpew, plz put your shit posts here to prevent shadow ban
"
kongburrito,I'll put in some work on the Zelda page this evening. 
kongburrito,It's so perfect. :) Good catch
kongburrito,"Thanks for the response!

Muting players helps, but its hard to do when games are so fast paced, and there is little downtime. 

Cheers, hope the launch is treating you two well!"
kongburrito,"Let me know where you decide to go. When you get kidnapped, I just need to make sure I can report it."
kongburrito,"AutoMOD removed it, I just approved."
kongburrito,"Please get the gif done. Even a picture of the quarter/half circles on the stick would be good.

A way I've seen it done by other games in the past is a prerecorded action is done by a computer with the game showing you what is being input. This way we know what actions to complete and what result to expect."
kongburrito,Exactly what he is doing. I'm almost a Rocketeer on rocket league. This game will not reach that level of competition. 
kongburrito,"They are peer to peer servers, not dedicated servers..."
kongburrito,These were a flaw with rocket league on release and you cannot condemn the game because of it.
kongburrito,"There has never been a case where a game has received a platinum after release, unless it was a release of the game (only example I have off the top of my head is Back to The Future the game)"
kongburrito,"That's what it felt like. 
A matchmaking system like this will not do for the long run of the game, I hope they look into changing this."
kongburrito,"The fault of secondary objectives is it forces a playstyle. One of the arguements in the rocket league community was wether or not you should be able to display titles earned from your Certifiable toppers (toppers that track stats such as saves, turtle goals, aerials, bicycle hits, etc).

The concern is once you tell a player that he can show off the number of turtle goals he gets, he will then focus on turtle goals, which are impractical and hurt the team dynamic. That's always a concern, especially in a matchmaking system that does not have a seperation between friendly games and a ranked ladder."
kongburrito,"Noted, I was not aware.

I have only gotten skins so I didn't even know you could get them that way. I figured they were something that is earned."
kongburrito,"No, this will not be the next rocket league.

I have about 700 hours in rocket league. I have 1,000+ hours in fighting games.

I don't think this game has the depth to be the next rocket league. The skill ceiling is too low. There is an execution aspect to it, but the game feels like you are waiting for your opponent to mess up more than you are waiting to outplay them.

In Rocket League, I have a constant feeling of knowing other players strengths and weaknesses. Player Y is great at aerials. Player X has strong long shots.

In Disc Jam, I fail to see the depth there. I know when another player is better, but the skill seems to be one more of consistency than anything else. They can consistently catch the disc. It took me 10 minutes to understand what an optimal shot placement would be, and I imagine an hour or two in training and I will have the shots on lock.

 If an opponent is in the center of their side, there are  (potentitally none?) one or two shots that they Physically cannot save. You can force them into awkward positions, but again, there are very few options. Matches become endless volleys, until one player makes one critical mistake that ends an entire match.

With such short games, these high risk scenarios feel like a glaring flaw. If I fuck up in Rocket League, I have a 5 minute game to attempt to come back. If I fuck up smash bros, I have 4 lives in which I can come back. I don't see the potential for come backs here, especially when an entire set can come down to one play.

This feels very ranty and incoherent and I'm sure theres lots of holes in the arguement. But I stand by the idea that the skill ceiling in this game is incredibly low when compared to a traditional fighter, or a an competitive arcade game like rocket league.

tldr; nah m8, sry"

If you're on desktop, under the suscribe button there is a button to show your ""flair"" and edit it. From there you can edit what yours says! You can copy and paste mine if you need a template"

kongburrito,"Our streamer has the capability, but I believe for this tournament we had it cycling for ease of use on the stream. Tourney attendance is small and we don't have a dedicated streamer. Hopefully we get the turnout to do this in the future :)"

kongburrito,"I actually believe it is all on Deviant art (minus squirtle and ivysaur, as those were custom made). I'm getting the name of the artist now."
kongburrito,"K.
I thought it was cool, and didn't have a better ttitle."
kongburrito,Nice! I'm sure it feels so good to knock out all these games!
kongburrito,Generally the CODs are that rare because they have such a huge player base for their online.
kongburrito,"Ill pass that to our streamer! He'll be happy to hear it.

I love the stained glass character art."
kongburrito,"Congrats!

The first one is really easy. This one has one checkpoint or flag race that is silly hard compared to the rest of the game. Nothing else was hard in my opinion but that single race."
kongburrito,It wasn't about being famous. People saying that Disc Jam will be more popular than Rocket League as a competitive game are misguided. 
kongburrito,"Do you not believe in the freedom of press?
Why do you think it is acceptable to call someone fake news for not utilizing a primary source and then trying to cut all their ties to the primary source?

I can't help but feel like you're trying to defend an action because of who has done it rather than the fact that you believe it was right."
kongburrito,"Yes.

If psnprofiles show them as seperate list you can generally do them on the same account to  (minus some vita games)"
kongburrito,"If you liked it, I recommend 1 and 3 also. 1 is also pretty easy to plat."
kongburrito,Very fun game! I platted it on the Ps3 and really enjoyed it :)
kongburrito,"After 3 years, I decided recently that I would wrap up the Rock Paper Scissors trophy I was missing from The Walking Dead.

I also decided to complete Ratchet and Clank 2, which required me to recomplete the game due to a glitch I encountered with one skill point. Plat time was 3 years 7 months!

I was missing one hard trophy in Assault Android Cactus, so I finally grabbed my plat after sitting on the game for three months. That ultra rare felt good!

I started Starwhal on a whim, and one day decided it was finally time to grind out the versus kills. Plat time, 1 year 5 mo.

I would have to say that the biggest offender was Prototype. The only trophy I was missing was the 56k infected kills trophy. I had to restart the game as I ahd lost my save file. Finally I decided to just do it one day, ending with a plat time of 4 years, 5 months."
kongburrito,If you end up needing help just shoot me a message!
kongburrito,"I actually finished it on ps3 a while back. 

It was annoying but a lot easier than I recall back then."
kongburrito,"I really recommend doing Life Is Strange. Easy plat, and I enjoyed it a lot more than any Telltale."
kongburrito,"Thanks man. My thesis is going really well right now so I'm happy I've had the time to play before I get into my last semester of college and start a big boy job. Life will smooth and you'll find time! 

Cheers!"
kongburrito,"How do you think that Trump has done his part?

I think that saying that one side is choosing to resist the other is almost a sign of how split the parties have become if they choose not to agree. I believe that the president should play a role in helping bring the two to a place where they can agree. I think that we saw much of the same resistance during the Obama adminstration and that he often failed to address the issue.

Do you not think that ""resistance"" is a sign of how bipartisan our government has become?

kongburrito,"Thanks, glad to see you were able to finish off the kills too! "
kongburrito,"Yeah, thats the strategy I've been using. I find that the boss can need only blues, I snag a combo of blues, and then the boss hits a chain that forces 4 blues to end up next to eachother at the end. I never feel like the game is more stacked against me than when I do these boss battles."
kongburrito,"Fuck the boss levels. I'm stuck on one right now (I have been all weekend) and they just seem so unfair. The bosses predict these unreal cascades or utilize pieces not on the board yet. I feel like the way to balance them would be to give the player their special abilities still, but fat chance that would happen. 

Pretty cool the free cards get better though. Do you find that you are receiving better drops overall?"
kongburrito,What is different between the first playthrough and the second? Just curious. I'm around level 400 and I know I have a lot to do prior to new playthrough.
kongburrito,"You know what sub you're on right? 

Like we're the definition of a circle jerk here."
kongburrito,What is left to hundred percent that makes it harder than the plat?
kongburrito,"Yeah, I should be around. If you added me just shoot me a message around that time."
kongburrito,"I suffered from arrhythmia. I honestly don't recall anything unusual that lead up to the events.  I simply recall that I was doing online banking, and then awoke in the hospital. "
kongburrito,"I'm US Eastern also. 

I'm generally online after 6PM, to about 10PM. 

weekends I'm generally on if I'm home, but if life jumps in the way, maybe not.

This trophy shouldnt take more than like, 30 minutes? I think it requires 3 people MAYBE."
kongburrito,"I thought I recalled getting them with only two players... 

We can do them, add me at dgaustin. I'd be happy to help this weekend. I already have plat."
kongburrito,"Oh whoops, I just mixed up Bunkr and RK5...

I have a level 50 Nisha and a level 40 Claptrap ready to help then..."
kongburrito,Which playthrough? I have a level 40 sal and a 50 maya who can help depending on the playthrough.
kongburrito,"Hope no one had headphones on

kongburrito,What are you trying to say. You didn't like world's best driver?
kongburrito,"You can expect to see it on the first Tuesday of the month, so this month that falls on Febuary 7th"
kongburrito,"I'll be on in 5 hours, you can add me at dgaustin, and I can help you through an online match."
kongburrito,"PS1: Spyro is incredibly nostalgic for me, so I'd recommend the original trilogy. Crash Bandicoot

PS2: Psychonauts, ratchet and clank series, jak and daxter, gun, God Of War, Red Dead Revolver,Grand Theft Auto, Max Payne, katamari damacy and we love katamari, Shadow of the Colossus

PS3: Call of Duty begins to hit strides here, so I'd recommend the best CoD imo MW2. I'd recommend continuing Ratchet And Clank and God of War series here. Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, Injustice, Skyrim (although maybe its better suited for Ps4) Fallout 3/NV/4, Tomb Raider, Journey, Borderlands 1/2 (skipping pre-sequel), Katamari Forever, guacamelee, wipeout HD

Ps4: The last of us, The last gaurdian, ratchet and Clank, DOOM, Wolfenstien New Order and Old Blood

I'm sure there are some glaring holes but this is a start to some of my favorite games of these generations"
kongburrito,You can earn trophies through shareplay. 
kongburrito,The other commenter is only talking about Hitman Go. There are other hitman games on sale that are not like this I beleive.
kongburrito,Got ya. I'm debating doing all three systems at once and am just thinking about the logistics XD
kongburrito,"Silly question, but I havent played yet. Is the Fable book collection doable on your first playthrough, without forcing certain options?"
kongburrito,"If you have the account activated as a primary on your system, then you can play online using it's Plus membership on any other account. I know other players that have used a European PS+ to play games on their US account."
kongburrito,"What subreddit would you suggest they post it to? I think that this subreddit is the most active when it comes to more generaly playstation support questions, and on any other ps sub it is most likely to get buried by news"
kongburrito,"No, the games are tied to the account, not the system.
To get the games you had befoer, you would need to continue your subscription on the same account you previously used."
kongburrito,"I dont know about mobile, if you're using it, but for desktop on the side under the subscribe/unsubscribe button you can edit your flair."
kongburrito,I've been excited to play this game I'd love to get a copy!
kongburrito,"Hey, shoot me a message with a friend request. I won't be able to do it til monday,  but I can help boost it for you. I've already completed the online, so we can just knock it out for you."
kongburrito,Awesome little project. The thought of playing with cold hands is awful enough for me though! Glad you guys had fun with it :)

kongburrito,Will you be on tonight? Sorry I missed you last night.
kongburrito,Please mark the trade as closed
kongburrito,Hey I'm really interested in the black crown. Would you take crates for it?
kongburrito,Okay I should be on tonight for a little 6-7hrs from now. Add me at dgaustin
kongburrito,Add me at dgaustin. I'm going to be around alll weekend and can knock this one out with you. If you need an easy certified item I can help also
kongburrito,Haha who is he?
kongburrito,"I'll be on in about 8-9hrs, can you hold it? You can add me at dgaustin"
kongburrito,"4 crowns,  for purple vortex or sky blue zeta  (I think that's the name), and I'll sweeten it with a couple crates?"
kongburrito,Which crowns are left? If be happy to trade for crates
kongburrito,"I would like the cobalt crown.  I have a couple painted toppers, I'll let you pick the one you want

Forest green mariachi

Saffron mariachi 

Orange b day cake

Brown chainsaw"
kongburrito,"Found a fifth,  still want to trade?"
kongburrito,I have 4c3
kongburrito,"I'd be willing to do 3, buyers choice"
kongburrito,"Haha, I'm sure you'll find some soon!

Just keep complaining to Psyonix, that seems to help drop rates."
kongburrito,"I haven't traded any of my halloween items on the PS4. Played about 100+ games since unlocked the previous item, still haven't uncovered a ghost :(

Edit: I have found 3 painted wheels though maybe this is what the RNGods want"
kongburrito,"Alright, thanks for the response."
kongburrito,"I am interested in the black crown, but my keys have a timer. Are you willing to hold it? I'll see if I can borrow from a friend to get them sooner."
kongburrito,I would like the black royal crown. Would you be interested in trading them for my chakrams?
kongburrito,"My keys have a 4 hr wait, but I'll be available in about 9hrs due to school. Does that work for you?"
kongburrito,"Sky blue rat rods for 1 key,  add me dgaustin."
kongburrito,I don't know if that works with your friends to be the first mistake and the other sheet music video for a few weeks.
kongburrito,The only one that I can do it for the phikeia ed position because It's a position I've been passionate to be a ref I am not a big ass the house and the other hand is the most southern California for a few.
kongburrito,Lana Del Rey singing to me would probably have me melted in two hours top 
kongburrito,What are you looking for?
kongburrito,"I'm willing to 2 crates, one being a C2, other your choice."
kongburrito,ARe you still looking to trade the crown? I can offer crates.
kongburrito,It says you want the lime and pink wizard hats and you had offers. I assumed the items in the post were things you had...
kongburrito,I will give you crates for the black crown? 2 crates for the crown?
kongburrito,I have all three crowns you want.  New Breakout for all three?
kongburrito,No please this is all the Gizmo gets.
kongburrito,"If you have one PS4, make sure the account that purchased playstation plus is activated as the primary user. This makes it so other accounts on the same PS4 can use the plus."
kongburrito,I think part of his point is that 2v2 solo q or team q is similar while 3v3 solo and team are almost complete different games.
kongburrito,I don't sorry.
kongburrito,"I will be home in about 2 hrs.
"
kongburrito,Ill take the wizard I'd like to look at the cobalt derby before I make a decision if thats okay. Will you be online later? Add me at dgaustin.
kongburrito,Crown For either the Traheres and a painted topper or two painted toppers?
kongburrito,"On Ps4? I will trade 2 keys for it.
"
kongburrito,"I have keys to trade. If someoone will give me both in a single trade, I'll give them an extra key for the sake of convienence."
kongburrito,I have a grey crown. Offer? I am not interested in decals.
kongburrito,I'll buy your Orange Crown for a key and a crate. Message me here or on PSN at Dgaustin
kongburrito,I have the Grey Crown. Looking for crates or keys.
kongburrito,"No, that be an awful deal for me. I'd do like a crate for it."
kongburrito,What would you like for it?
kongburrito,"If you're on ps4 I have ever extras. My car is also pink sunburst takumi, with a pink crown. Gold nugget and labyrinth paint though."
kongburrito,"Great explanation, thanks. 

I agree with how you guys categorize it, most of my stage size knowledge is simply from ""feeling.""
"
kongburrito,"It seems silly to have Green Hill, a relatively small stage, on the starter list without a very large stage to combat it. I understand dreamland isn't necessarily the best example, but I always equate Warioland and GHZ as very similar due to the extremely short blast zones."
kongburrito,Is the black crown still available? I messaged you and got no response.
kongburrito,"I can lend you a certified item for centers/clears. Should make it easier for you.
Add me at dgaustin. Unfortunately, I wont be on til next Tuesday though."
kongburrito,Cat.
kongburrito,Cat.
kongburrito,"Fair enough man, if thats the markey price, thats the markey price."
kongburrito,"I think my big problem with switching to Zelda to recover as sheik is this....

When you have time to transform, you're in one of two scenarios 
A) You're pretty high up. This means you're probably at a death percent with sheik (and even more likely to be at a death percent with zelda). YOu're high enough you can probably recover as sheik, but of course being Zelda would give you more options.
B) You're a pretty far out. Switching to Zelda now will give you the range to get to the ledge, but the delay from transform to teleport probably means you're going to be low enoguh where your remaining recovery options are extremely limited. As in, Tele to ledge or right above it. A competent player can probably stop both of these. It gives you a chance of survival, but it's slim a lot of the time. Slim is better then Zilch though.

Sure there are more situations, but those are the two I think most players think would be best to switch, and why I find it  to not always be an ideal option."
kongburrito,30 Keys? Am I the only one that finds this price pretty high for the BM decal?
kongburrito,"What stages do you think benefit ganon the most in this match up?
I'd say both characters are killing off of the side more often than the top, but the smaller stages give Zelda a lot less room to zone. PI think FD is very strongly in Zelda's favor, as removing a lot of movement options forces the Ganon to either have reduced options, or commit to a move to challenge a dins fire.

As for float shenanigans, I think that if a Zelda isn't caught sitting in sheild, she has some good options. Land cancel nayru's,fadeback lightning kick, or teleport all come to mind, not to say a Ganon can't punish those. "
kongburrito,"Do you have any recorded sets? I know watching myself play (while embarassing sometimes) gives me a lot of ideas on how I need to improve. 

"
kongburrito,"I don't have one on hand because I'm at work. Depending on how close Zelda is to the ledge though, going at ledge height can get her a wide variety of places on the stage, forcing ganon to really commit to an option early to cover some of them. I'll sift through a video or two and see if I can find a semi example of what I'm thinking of.

Edit: If you're talking about off stage moves, you're absolutely right. But if a ganon isnt going offstage to threaten you, this is a good option."
kongburrito,Interesting rebuild of the character. The Gordo's kind of sound like they could make for a great DI trap on throws in your iteration.
kongburrito,"My point was I'd just rather be sheik if the other player was switching. The sheik ditto is even and I think sheik is the winer of  Sheik Zelda's MU.

But yeah, I'd be willing to try a Shielda ditto with someone. "
kongburrito,"Sheik vs Zelda is probably my least favorite match up to play as Zelda. Granted it's been a while and I've improved a lot since, but I think it's one of Zelda's harder match ups."
kongburrito,"Yeah, I was doing a good job punishing it for a little, then I just sort of fell apart on it.

I'll definitely try to incorporate that into my play from here on out. I don't get a lot of practice with a good ness (only a very bad one) so I have a lot of bad habits in that match up to kick."
kongburrito,2 keys for the sunbursts?
kongburrito,"I agree with this. If a Zelda begins teleport slightly above ledge height, she can easily tele-cancel on stage with no lag, or telecancel short and grab ledge, so the ganon has to guess a lot. Ganon's upair can kill Zelda super easy during the start up of her teleport, and I think that is the threat the ganon player really needs to utilize in this match up."
kongburrito,"Yeah that was me. I don't think you can Nayru's Flash? Edge guarding with PK Thunder with Nayru's is good, but Fourdy recovers high a lot, so that knocks out Nayru's if you're looking to cover multiple options. Thanks for the advice! "
kongburrito,He's a madman I say! Madman!
kongburrito,Interested in the grey crown?
kongburrito,If you still want to do Pink Sunbursts for the Slipstream I have PSB's
kongburrito,"I think this match up is pretty even, and honestly very fun to play. Zelda is very floaty so she dies off the top easily in this match up, and Wario can give her a very hard time getting back on stage from up high. That being said, Zelda has a lot of options to shut down Wario's approaches. GOOO! is negated very well with Din's and Nayru's, but is very good at catching a Zelda that tries to recover on stage. 
Wario's Dair is relatively week in this match up in my opinion, as it doesn't trade with Upsmash (although it might with Up-Tilit). 

NaClG (Zelda) vs HiFi (Wario) @ 35:20

kongburrito,"I really like 4 character pools. Gives people more opportunities to talk about their character when it comes up, and more characters will come up more often. Obviously theres a limit to the number of characters that it makes sense doing each week, and I think 4 is the peak. Thanks for running these :)"
kongburrito,"This match up feels near even, but edges towards bad for Zelda, but it might be because I play it wrong. Ness is hard to combo, but I think there are a lot of options to kill him earlier than most other characters. Din's fire cannot be used in Zoning as Ness can simply Ness Shine (or whatever the term is) the din's. Therefore, the only great use of Din's in this match up is to force orbit to protect some approach options, or try and gimp Ness's recovery. Din's at ledge or on stage simply gives Ness some free recovery.

kongburrito,If Zelda dittos didn't exist I think the world would be a happier place. Thank god for 8 minute timers.
kongburrito,"As a Zelda main I play this match up constantly, and I think it is atleast 6:4 in Zelda's favor if not better.

Ganon's recovery isn't very good, as we all know. Placing a din's fire at ledge height force ganon to recovery high. as recovering low will have him eating percentages from Din's. This is crazy easy to punish, with a either a kick if they go very high or an F-Smash if they try to side-b above ledge.

On top of that, Zelda's combo game on Ganon is really powerful. Upsmash at lower percents, easy sheild pokes with Nair on platforms. Ganon gets some early kills on Zelda, but at higher percents can't follow up on a lot of his set ups. I believe Ganon has a chainthrow on Zelda, but it doesn't work at very high percents. 

At low percents, Zelda up throw leads to 60-80% damage every time, with very easy reactions to DI.

If people would like I can try to find some old games of mine, but I imagine there is a better Zelda ready to show it off."
kongburrito,He? Did you just assume his gender?
kongburrito,How long do you think it takes?
kongburrito,"I really enjoy teleporting behind reverse grab. It catches people off guard, and I dont do it more than once a set because I'm not quick enough generally."
kongburrito,"1/10, would not want to watch either."
kongburrito,"[PS4]
I am collecting pigeons and royal crowns."
kongburrito,I dont think that this match up is awful. I think the zelda is on the defensive a lot more but you can definitely win it as a super aggro Sonic.
kongburrito,"For me of us who are not familiar, what is the walking box taunt? How does that help you recognize the build?"
kongburrito,I highly recommend bo5 in on losers winners and grands. Especially with a smaller tournament.
kongburrito,I think it's bad I do not recommend drinking milk and sneezing simoultaneously 
kongburrito,"What match up do you dislike playing in this game? (ideally with your main)

Personally, I really do no enjoy Zelda Vs Samus. I think that Zelda just tries to out camp Samus, and because it's so floaty, neither character can combo the other to death well."
kongburrito,"Right, I get the key to jokes is to do such a thing. That's most of the jokes in this thread. Oh well, maybe I was expecting too much and the fall from expectations was harsher than funny."
kongburrito,"Hmm. I guess it's just not my sense of anti joke humor then? I just don't get how these guys are dying over it, even with internet exaggeration."
kongburrito,Is it really a good joke? I had the same reaction as you.
kongburrito,"He probably TAS'd out a lot of these things, I think saying he his high is a little silly?"
kongburrito,"What time zone are you in? 
If you shoot me a Friend Request @ dgaustin I can explain it, I'm pretty versed in rocket league at this point."
kongburrito,"I think part of the beauty of this game though is at the end, I made the choices I wanted to make. I didn't want to experience it any other way. I made the choices I felt were right and had to deal with the consequences as they came to me. I think forcing me to go through the game in multiple ways doesn't make the game more fun, challenging, or a better experience. I'd argue it diminishes from these things.

Not all platinums are meant to be hard. The developers probably put lots of thought into how they wanted to award the trophies, and I think they made the right choice."
kongburrito,"Like the other guy said,  try the thermal paste first.  

Anyways,  back to your question,  it really depends on your budget. The ps3 has a very large library of games,  many of which you can find for am extremely good prie more die to its age. 

If your budget has room,  I'd say bite on next gen.  There have been plenty of critically acclaimed games,  and if you've had playstation plus in the past you may have built up quite a library yourself.  If not,  some bigger titles are still going to put you back 20 odd bucks, and there's a lot of pull pm digital which has no resale value."
kongburrito,"I would hoinestly buy a new system if you have the funds to. I have had a couple PS3's burn out with me, and I've found that repairing them is a money sink. They generally end up not working."
kongburrito,"Hey bud.
I can't help you with the turtle goals.

I would be happy to lend you another certified item that will make it easier. I some certified for clears and centers, and you're far more likely to get those than turtle goals."
kongburrito,Alright. I'm not dying to drop 6 crates in addition to my favorite wheels right now. Gotta keep that pink car fly.
kongburrito,I have forest green Lowriders and traheres. Interested in either?
kongburrito,I'm interested in the dom gt.
kongburrito,I get that. Are you willing to drop to 4 crates?
kongburrito,Not willing to do six crates. Are you interested in keys?
kongburrito,I'm in for a wager match. Pigeon vs Pigeon?
kongburrito,"I dont think a certified topper is worth a set of painted wheels. 

I'll keep looking around, thanks."
kongburrito,Hey I would love your certified royal crown. It's not worth a full crate or key to me.  Is there anything else you're looking for?
kongburrito,I will do the pink photons for my pink sunbursts. Interested?
kongburrito,I will play this when I get home tonight.
kongburrito,"Sorry, I am only looking for orange and black."
kongburrito,"Are you on PSN?
What do you want for the black crown?
"
kongburrito,lol I think that's me too. Dgaustin?
kongburrito,Two crates and two keys? I'm not willing to do that.
kongburrito,"Deal, add me at dgaustin"
kongburrito,They can be.
kongburrito,I only need the saffron for now.  How is two crates?
kongburrito,What are you looking for?
kongburrito,I'll trade a certified for a certified.
kongburrito,Plz ban him.
kongburrito,"Sorry, only looking for crowns at the moment."
kongburrito,"Second thought, I'm going to hold off."
kongburrito,"Hey I am looking  for the sky blue and orange crown. Would you take 2 keys and two crates for both of them?
"
kongburrito,I actually have both these
kongburrito,Take 2 vs G2 was a great set to watch.
kongburrito,"The weird part is an overhand shuffle could produce the same effect, but I think the hindu shuffle has ""more"" steps that cause the audience to lose track of what you are actually doing,
"
kongburrito,I will do 2 keys 1 crate for the sunburst
kongburrito,Are you interested in grey rat rods?
kongburrito,I have forest green traheres and lowriders
kongburrito,What's your tag?
kongburrito,"Sorry, I have a lot of them but im actually missing three of the ones you ask for and the saffron. Oh well, I'll get another;]"
kongburrito,Will be online within the hour
kongburrito,"I have to check when I get home.  I believe challenger 3, partner is 2 or 1"
kongburrito,I'll do this deal. Add me at dgaustin.
kongburrito,I'm interested in a 2v2 duel. Each team puts up one painted item. You in?
kongburrito,"The good news is the only genre that doesn't particularly grab me is RPG, so that leaves me with a lot of other genres to play. Good luck with the hunts."
kongburrito,"I've stopped playing games I don't want to, simple as that. 
Some games that aren't as good as what I'd like to play but I still would like to complete, I attack a bite at a time. A few levels today, a few tomorrow, a couple over the weekend. This helps me take chunks out of the game.

I also strongly suggest switching around genres of games. Sometimes playing too many open world games in a row burns me out. Too many racing games in a row will do the same thing. My last games, not including multiregion stacks, have been a Platformer, Arena Shooter, FPS, Racing, and storybook games. Looking back, the two back to back plats with the closest genre I have are Guacamelee and Rogue Legacy, and that was almost 50 plats ago."
kongburrito,Is it really? I just dont get it I think it's one of the less appealing crowns.
kongburrito,"I really agree with this. Sure some characters are unbalanced now but no matter what we do, some character will emerge from the meta. I think it is better to fix some broken things rather than try to rebalance."
kongburrito,That seems pretty steep for just 1 crown. I'd be more interested in 2 keys or 2 crates.
kongburrito,"How many keys for each:
Heatwave,
Guardian MK2"
kongburrito,I'm interested in the black crown. How many crates or keys are you looking for?
kongburrito,"I don't believe he went on a rampage. He didn't glitch the game, the server could not handle how many people were in a 99 construction house party."
kongburrito,It's necessary to do the hindu shuffle in some instances. I think the good thing is to an average bystander they generally don't know the different kinds of shuffles.
kongburrito,"I have 6 left right now, if you want more I will have to purchase more or borrow some from a friend since the new ones will not be tradable for 1 wk."
kongburrito,Are you interested in keys now that they are tradable on Ps4?
kongburrito,"Eh, I think I will hold onto my sunbursts for now. Not too interested in the inventory. Thanks."
kongburrito,What colors would you want for the Mk2?
kongburrito,I'm interested in this deal. What are the toppers?
kongburrito,"If you enjoyed it I highly recommend Riptide Renegade. I think it improves some of the issues, and they gameplay is just as fun. A lot longer of a game, with a ""critically acclaimed"" (/s) story"
kongburrito,"Wait, is the black crown really the most popular? If it wasnt just something I needed for my collection I'd likely skip it entirely."
kongburrito,"I really liked his execution of the trick, I think he handled the DLs pretty well."
kongburrito,This is a great deal you should def do this
kongburrito,"Black crown is 5 crates? Curious, why so high"
kongburrito,"I have a grey crown,  Any interest?"
kongburrito,Ib have a grey crown. Trade for wiz hat?
kongburrito,Alright. I'm not particularly dying for the skin so no fears. 
kongburrito,"I'm in bed for the night, I'll trade tomorrow evening though for that deal. "
kongburrito,"I have an x devil snake skin, do you have anything else"
kongburrito,"I think that's pretty steep for just one crown, especially white. Maybe 2?"
kongburrito,I do have crates. What do you feel is fair?
kongburrito,"Mariachi hat. I'm on now, add me at dgaustin "
kongburrito,I have a sky blue homburg. Trade for one of your painted?
kongburrito,Labyrinth for the heatwave?
kongburrito,Pink Loopers?
kongburrito,1 C2 crate for your Orange Crown?
kongburrito,1 C2 crate for the lime crown?
kongburrito,Your Lime Crown for my 1 C2 crate?
kongburrito,The Keys in game say not tradable last time I checked. Has any one tried?
kongburrito,"I have a labyrinth decal, do you feel that is a fair trade?"
kongburrito,"Sounds great, looking forward to it :)"
kongburrito,Darn. Still would love to 1v1 you for a crown ;)
kongburrito,"I'm in NA, unfortunately.  Maybe next time. "
kongburrito,I'll do a double or nothing for a c2 crate with you. 
kongburrito,"I'm ps4 challenger 3 in solo duel. I will stake an item,  but am I eligible?"
kongburrito,"I'm not trying to be mean, just showing where my point of view comes from  "
kongburrito,Hey beta nugget buddy. I'm also at 22 days myself. Crazy how time flies :)
kongburrito,"I think if you played more games (assuming your under 100 since you didn't get all the items) you would understand how different each of the release game modes is from eachother. Once you get into each mode, the differences become extremely appearent. "
kongburrito,People value the black markets as much as the beta nugget? that's insane.
kongburrito,"Epic Saves I believe, but I'm not able to check atm."
kongburrito,"Pretty cool, but that jingle got kind of annoying. Good video overall"
kongburrito,"I have a certified RX-T and I'd be willing to bite on this. Lime and Sky Blue sunburst, and if you could sweet the deal with a coule crates."
kongburrito,"I mean decals, my mistake."
kongburrito,"When it first game out there were different maps, all aesthetic though. There were also 4 game modes on release (1v1, 2v2, 3v3. 4v4).

There are now different modes such as Snow Day, Hoops, Rocket Labs, and Rumble, but the core game is still the same. If you really dont want to play. keep going into a ranked 1v1 and forfeiting. I think it counts as a completed game and you get an item still."
kongburrito,9:00 PM to 3:00 AM GMT for me. 
kongburrito,"To be fair, getting every item is no luck and only requires you to play the game. If you don't want to play 150 games of Rocket League, maybe don't go for the platinum."
kongburrito,"Hey I will trade you for tge crown.  I have lots of certified items,  I can show you when I get home today"
kongburrito,He could not be of age to get a job.
kongburrito,2 crates for pirate hat?
kongburrito,"Eh, hard pass then"
kongburrito,"I'm looking for the black , forest, and orange crown. How many crates for all three?"
kongburrito,"That's insanely steep in my eyes, I'll sit for now then."
kongburrito,Wow I'm dumb. Pardon my shitty reading comprehension 
kongburrito,I see you put up four items for 4 crates . I offered you a crate for one of them man.
kongburrito,How much for the lime sunburst? 
kongburrito,I'll give you a crate for just the pink tunicas.
kongburrito,I also have an orange fruit hat. Does that interest you?
kongburrito,Do you not want one at all or just not that offer
kongburrito,"I have the grey fruit hat. 
For sunburst or cobalt crown?"
kongburrito,Hey I'm interested in the saffron crown.  I have grey  rat rods to trade. I have a lot of the car specific paints too 
kongburrito,Hey what car do you use. I have  lots of the new skins we can trade for
kongburrito,A grey fruit hat
kongburrito,I'll do it for two crates.  Message me at dgaustin I'm on nor
kongburrito,I'm interested but I'll have my next crates tied to another trade now. If they're still available when I get more I'll reach out to you. Good luck.
kongburrito,"Hmm. Maybe I'll look to do a 1 for 1. I've been wanting to get every crown and I was looking to do 2 crowns for the laby, but I think its a lot rarer than I thought."
kongburrito,"I have to earn some more, but I CS1 is worth a lot more than CS2 right now.
"
kongburrito,"The advantage of the three card monte (and on a level the cups and balls) is that even if you know the sleight that is involved in it, you can still be fooled. The problem is how easy it is to fake out ""the move."" 

I played three card monte on a train with a guy one time. Caught the move a couple times, we talked about sleight for a little bit. Even knowing the exact move he was pulling every time, it's incredibly hard to follow."
kongburrito,"What are the names of the other 3?
"
kongburrito,"Eh, I feel 1 for 1 is fair. What do you feel?"
kongburrito,I also have two Laby's. I got mine back to back.
kongburrito,Any desire for Forest Geen Lowriders?
kongburrito,"All painted crowns, and some good Mono-Color designs. Currently completed a Full Pink design."
kongburrito,Would you do the Rat Rods for any of the new decals? I have most of them available. I'd also be willing to give crates.
kongburrito,Painted wheels but I dont really want to make the offer unfair to you. Whats the crown cert'd for?
kongburrito,"Jamestown + Is also an amazing multiplayer I agree with. Getting four people in an easy level is fun, and challenging the guantlet on Divine or Judgement has made for some insanely fun evenings."
kongburrito,"I second this. Its insanely fun with two players, and it gets insanely frantic with 4. Probably my local multiplayer go to now a days."
kongburrito,Painted royal crown Or a forest green topper?
kongburrito,I'd like to start at 7. I dont think that is steep considering how few people I have heard got them.
kongburrito,"A 70-year-old man goes to the doctor's for a physical. The doctor runs some tests and says to the man, ''Well, everything seems to be in top condition physically, but what about mentally?""

 And the man says, ""Well doctor, I've found God. We have an extreme bond and he's good to me. Every night when I have to get up to go to the bathroom, he turns on the light for me, and then every time  when I leave, he turns it back off.'' 

Well, upon hearing this the doctor was astonished and he sends the man on his way. 

The next day the man's wife called the doctor to see how the check up went.

The doctor said ""Well Edith, I'm astonished by your husband's connection with God. He claims that every night when he needs to use the restroom, God turns on the light for him and turns it off for him again when he leaves. Is this true?'' 

The wife responds ""God damn it, he's peeing in the fridge again.""
"
kongburrito,"Woah Demetri Martin, I didn't know you played rocket league "
kongburrito,"Give me an add at Dgaustin. I'm off to bed and dont want to forget,"
kongburrito,"Noted, I'll keep that in mind
"
kongburrito,Actually picked up a cobalt today when somebody thought it was sky blue. Thanks for the offer though.
kongburrito,I'm looking for any painted crowns. Obviously you dont want to trade for your black one but perhaps if you get ahold of another we can do business.
kongburrito,"The current offer I have is 2 painted crowns and a crate. I guess I underestimated the cost of these decals when I started negotiation. I'm looking for painted crowns, so if I could get 2+ that be ideal. Forest green toppers also are interested."
kongburrito,I have grey rat rods.  Are you interested at all? 
kongburrito,"How much are you willing to put in for a Labrynth Decal?
"
kongburrito,Alright. Let me know what you end up getting for those pink Sunbursts.
kongburrito,"I have a crate I can trade you.
PSN: dgaustin"
kongburrito,Hey I have Grey Rat Rods. Do those interest you at all?
kongburrito,"Yeah man that's my mistake. I apologize.
"
kongburrito,"Eh my guy who wanted the bow backed out on me, so I think I'm gonna have to drop. Sorry"
kongburrito,"Hey, would you want to do Champ 2 crate for just the crown?"
kongburrito,I also have the octane dragon.
kongburrito,"No thanks, I actually have a Roadhog XL right now aswell."
kongburrito,"Sounds good, let me know :)
"
kongburrito,I would prefer my wins tracked rather than epic saves. I just like seeing how much I use a specific car :)
kongburrito,"Thursday night. It was my first (and second) crate.
"
kongburrito,"Would you be interest in the Crown, the Bow, and another lime Topper of your choice?"
kongburrito,"Okay. There was another guy in the thread with a purple crown. Check it out
"
kongburrito,"Sky Blue Homberg, Breakout Shibua (certed for scorer)"
kongburrito,"I'd really appreciate it. I have a couple things in return if youd be interested.
"
kongburrito,"Unfortunately due to the collection factor, I think I'm going to hold onto it man. If I get a chance for a duplicate, I'll definitely message you.

By the way, I believe grey is also a crown, so is yellow."
kongburrito,God damn it the word is labyrinth. Yeah that's the one
kongburrito,Every team DQ'd first round. Good games guys.
kongburrito,Moderator said in another thread they are working on it. Its a known prob
kongburrito,"On the second riddle, I always like to ask what is the last number of the sequence. 

The answer, following the pattern gives you 21322314, which ends up being cyclical."
kongburrito,Maybe if you have a low standard of living...
kongburrito,I generally switch to shiek.  Atleast that ditto is doable
kongburrito,"Some of them reminded me of katamari a lot, and that's one if my favorite games of all time. "
kongburrito,It caught me so off guard.  I didn't expect to like it this much.  I was just in it for a fast platinum but it turned into fun with races and time trials 
kongburrito,"The main fans had 6 tournaments.  The DLC adds 3 more,  and Additional challenge races.  Honestly a pretty good chunk of game for a couple bucks"
kongburrito,Wow I've seen players throw controllers but never with a clap before catching. Is that frame perfect tech?
kongburrito,No I'm not quite picking up what you're putting down 
kongburrito,I think you could develop a really solid set on the concept that things keep not going your way. Losing the card in the deck. Trying to color change a deck and getting a reverse deck instead. Man maybe I'll do it...
kongburrito,Damn I love the trap set ups on this.  I think those make for some of the best combos
kongburrito,Kealing by any chance?
kongburrito,I think that saying you've messed up and lost the card could turn into a cool rock.  Perhaps hand the deck back to the audience member along them to take out their signed card.  The reveal being that card isn't in the deck at all. 
kongburrito,Zelda vs Wolf in PM
kongburrito,Most Ganons in NC are ezpz.
kongburrito,MDZ with the true logic to reasoning combo
kongburrito,Worked for me
kongburrito,Plus everyone but like 3 of us are trash....
kongburrito,HP scottie?
kongburrito,"I think when I look at the bracket,  it's obvious he did his best seeding up to the top 40 atleast.  It gets hard to seed people across multiple regions. Like it's very hard to compare NC talent to MDVA talent when they've never really clashed that much."
kongburrito,What do you think was the problem with the seeding?
kongburrito,"The smash missiles hit harder, the og missiles go forever"
kongburrito,I think jurassic the hunted is a game you can't get in the uk but it's physical only to my knowledge
kongburrito,"Hit me up,  psn dgaustin"
kongburrito,"I honestly don't think there are any digitally exclusive US plats, but I do know there are regionally different ones. For example,  ziggurat eu and ziggurat us are the same game but they have seperate trophy lists"
kongburrito,The Moon. I didn't up vote until I realized and it took me a second. I hope others aren't doing the same.  
kongburrito,"I enjoyed playing even matches every time before.  Unfortunately I don't really care about the leaderboards,  so this update has done nothing but hurt my mid level experience in challenger. It wasn't like we were stomping people before,  we generally went 50/50. Now we're losing considerably more and it's far less fun. "
kongburrito,"Yeah but you have a lot of trophies in the trophies Suncrest
Sub so I don't like you.  /s"
kongburrito,"In 2014-2015, the player Leffen broke out and became the first player to successfully beat all 5 gods in a set. 

My favorite stat is out of the top 6, the Swedish player armada hasn't lost a tournament set to a non top 6 player since 2010. Honestly this is a feat of astonishing consistency that's unmatched in smash. I really hope I got these days right :)"
kongburrito,"He's killing it at locals, I know he went to bh."
kongburrito,Brah Sharkz  is another high levels Ice Climbera
kongburrito,Before the show they have to show the tricks to producers or something.  My guess is they don't let and luck by
kongburrito,Hey can we not put spoilers in the title please 
kongburrito,Battle Drummer!
kongburrito,That was brutal and beautiful.
kongburrito,"Hey man, good video. But the music is really loud compared to you talking in the start. It's pretty hard to hear you in the video. "
kongburrito,He has lots of jumps
kongburrito,"He's not in good shape,  but the posts from Corrinas friends on Facebook aren't painting it in a negative enough light for me to believe that he's dying.  That may be hopefulness,  I don't know. "
kongburrito,Jeez dude. I can't believe you got a 21 minute game. You must have been on fire with the orange combos :P
kongburrito,For context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po_FqB0ygUU
kongburrito,"Lets go bowling.
"
kongburrito,"Was HBox the anchor?
"
kongburrito,I just hopped on. What happened?
kongburrito,"Haha, it was a ruse!"
kongburrito,"I'll be in Southern Germany for a majority of my time, so if I can get a cheap TV that will be where I play."
kongburrito,The plug is different but I have a converter.  Thanks for the thoughts.
kongburrito,Never again? Man there are two other systems to get at! :)
kongburrito,I did not think it was bad. Yeah theres RNG but it isn't particularly hard once you learn the idea behind each level.
kongburrito,"Plants Vs Zombies is about a week of regular play.

Rocket League is short but very fun.

Super Exploding Zoo is very short, fun, and a good puzzle game.

I think Sound Shapes is easy, but many others disagree with me on that.

First Light is short, and you can expect a 6-15 hour plat.

Dyad was short, hard, and fun."
kongburrito,Who is the Mario player?
kongburrito,"Then save for the next sale if you don't like the offerings.
"
kongburrito,"Haha,  that be perfect, but I don't have the heart to play destiny. "
kongburrito,I should be. Just add me and shoot me a message. 
kongburrito,I play with a fellow from a city outside of london all the time. It may have been his connection...
kongburrito,"Shoot me an FR. Will you be on in an hour? Doing coop on BL2 right now.
"
kongburrito,"Think it will work if I'm in US? I'll help out
"
kongburrito,"Its a very fun puzzle game. Dirt cheap too
"
kongburrito,I didn't think 1 was that bad. I dont even remember struggling with the ranks.
kongburrito,Plants Vs Zombies was easy. Little luck and time based.
kongburrito,"I thought it was kind of dumb...
I just really didnt like the arcade mode."
kongburrito,I think it was humor.
kongburrito,High skill floor implies that at the base the character is good at a low level? A low skill floor says that the character is worse with equal skill. Maybe I am wrong.
kongburrito,"Expect to lose, but don't get down on that. This is just a time to get better. I suggest playing a character with a high skill floor (sheik or marth imo) tonight, and sticking with them. Learn their moves and how it feels to play them. "
kongburrito,What's the most competitive game you've played? 
kongburrito,It isn't crossbuy unfortunately
kongburrito,"Oh that doesn't include the skill based trophies.... I think the grind is longer than that,  but I honestly didn't measure and that's what someone else said online"
kongburrito,"It's really a time sink.  If you have a vita, you can use that with remote play. 
I assume you have the ps4 version?  Is probably 8 hours of grinding"
kongburrito,"Geometry Wars 3 PS3, Japanese Arkham Asylum, Ether One.
If I have time I'd like to finish the BL2 DLC also :)"
kongburrito,"I had the hard trophies for a while, the grind is really the awful part. I was only missing the trophies after the first week.  I knocked out 1 of them 6 months ago,  the other this weekend,  one last night. 

If you want an ultra rare plat, go for it.  If holding down r2 and hitting x twice every 10 seconds 1000 times sounds like a grind,  that's not even the worst part. 

If you don't have two controllers,  don't even touch it.  If you are doing it on ps3 it's buggy and I would say don't even touch it. "
kongburrito,"Yeah, you can check my trophy log. I think it looks pretty funny!
I ended up getting the two plats within 30 seconds of each other
"
kongburrito,Grats on the hundredth plat. It's no small accomplishment!
kongburrito,"I played a lot of rocket league, so luckily enough of the skill transferred. Good luck!"
kongburrito,The trophy is painfully iffy with level specials
kongburrito,I'm doing these today! I have a small tv with the ps3 and a large one on the PS4!
kongburrito,Such is life.  We gotta scrub him into gear
kongburrito,KU?
kongburrito,Fraternity in flint mi. Lots of work on water distribution
kongburrito,"I did it in ps4, I found my reactions are quicker on it"
kongburrito,"Velocity 2x is hard,  but I think you can do it.  There are 2-3 extremely hard levels,  the rest come down to muscle memories.  Practice makes perfect!  :)"
kongburrito,"The colossus hits too close.  I think I need one and the all stunts trophy. Maybe I'll knock it out soon,  but I haven't played in a long time. .."
kongburrito,I've never heard of this game.  How does it play? 
kongburrito,Good start.  This is one of the few games that I go back to after having all the trophies.  Probably one of the best games I've ever played. 
kongburrito,"I did it with a group of four.  It was not worth it,  and I'm also into insomniac games.  The plat requires four for one trophy,  and atleast two for the campaign and score missions. The characters are duller than doorknobs and about as exciting as a dirty Dishman

Only fun if you can make it fun with a group"
kongburrito,"So I feel the best trophy I earned this week was in Hardware Rivals. The last trophy I needed in this game was 1000 kills. The matchmaking sucked, the trophies never registered, and the game was just not fun.

Of course, my final trophy was ""The Suffering"""
kongburrito,I'll join the raffle. I'll pay it forward after the platinum! 
kongburrito,Recently started Asylums Japanese version.  Not looking forward to this trophy again
kongburrito,http://psnprofiles.com/games
kongburrito,Do you think that online multiplayer is good for the franchise?  Will we see this patched trine 3 ever? 
kongburrito,What time? 
kongburrito,"Grats on velocity,  that's a hard one"
kongburrito,"I'm getting the same thing in game,  ps4 though. 
The lag is not enough to ruin the game.  The lag is enough to make competitive unenjoyable"
kongburrito,You got me! Good one!
kongburrito,"I've heard Hitman isnt awful. I didn't particularly enjoy T-Master
"
kongburrito,Its a cell phone game port.
kongburrito,How did you get this? I cant plat too hard.
kongburrito,Rogue legacy was an unexpected gem
kongburrito,"As a trophy hunter,  I get why people play them for trophies,  but when I see the hour or two hour times for the platinuns, I'm turned off from that person's profile. 

It's unfortunate it isn't easy to distinguish the legitimate players and the walkthrough following chumps"
kongburrito,"It ruins the purpose for me to purchase it, but I'd sell someone else trophies in a second. 

Some people are making money doing what they enjoy, and for some people thats playing a shitty VN on the vita."
kongburrito,"I believe he isn't a team, but what he does is so impressive it's hard not to be a little skeptical"
kongburrito,"Yeah, it's hard for me to say one way or other,  but it's not fair for me to act like he is without proof I don't have"
kongburrito,"I sent you a friend request on PSN
"
kongburrito,"That works well, I have a giftcard there
"
kongburrito,"Alright, starbucks? "
kongburrito,"Fuck man, you go hard. 
I'm a cozy coupe man myself. That leather interior though."
kongburrito,"I think that he might be a team, but he definitely works with groups to develop the fastest way to plat a game."
kongburrito,"He plays for more than 12 hours a day, and some people believe he is a group. I wont comment on that, but it is known that some other top trophy hunters are. 

"
kongburrito,"I got two words for you bubba.

Herby Fully Loaded"
kongburrito,"Yo if we talking vehicles with four wheels, let me show you my boy the mystery machine."
kongburrito,"Interested in etymology, but I mostly just know that word from an old flash game called clockwords. Typing letters with specific letters did damage to spiders as they tried to steal your shit. I built a deck (what specific letters provide bonus points) so that floccinaucinihilipilification always used every letter.

I'm not sure, but I don't think that Floccinaucinihilipilificating would fit on your typical scrabble board."
kongburrito,I'm a big fan of snow piercer. That's a nice train
kongburrito,"Thomas was modeled after one of my favorite trains ever,  the LB&amp;SCR"
kongburrito,"Unfortunately that isn't a thing,  as [Thomas Was Alone](http://psnprofiles.com/trophies/1932-Thomas-Was-Alone)"
kongburrito,"No,  sorry.  Wish Cory in the house made it over to the PS3"
kongburrito,"The base verb is floccinaucinihilipilificate.
Floccinaucinihilipilificating is probably the better one to know.  Higher value in scrabble by just 1 point over floccinaucinihilipilification "
kongburrito,"It is not ""I am floccinaucinihilipilification""
It is ""I am committing floccinaucinihilipilification"", with committing being my verb.

Look at this for example. I'm no English expert so I hope this makes sense
Dictating is a verb.
Dictation is a noun.  "
kongburrito,"No it is the noun for the action of estimating something as worthless.
Comes from the roots of Floccus, naucum, nihil, pilus, meaning whoso,  trifle, nothing,  and a hair respectively. /etymology

Example:
Dgaustin said the Hannah Montana plat is worthless.
Classic deeg, always committing floccinaucinihilipilification."
kongburrito,"Mostly.
My favorite word to spell then eat is floccinaucinihilipilification.
It is because it is long. "
kongburrito,Sometimes I go for alphabet nuggets.  Gotta spell some shit before I eat them up. 
kongburrito,Dinosaur shape required? 
kongburrito,"The bids At 100 dollars,  anyone going lower? ;)"
kongburrito,"He's turning his passion into a business. 

I don't agree with buying plats, and I wouldn't do it myself,  but if someone gave me money to beat games I enjoy,  I'd do it in a second.  There are large sites dedicated to selling trophies. 

I'm not tempted because trophies are my achievements,  and buying them would diminish the value"
kongburrito,"I'm in NA!
SCEA"
kongburrito,"In my eyes this game has a huge progression issue. I'm not getting considerably stronger (25% more damage) enemy's get more health (200%) and I'm not getting way more gold (22%)

Maybe I'm playing wrong? "
kongburrito,Grats! What game are you working on next? 
kongburrito,This is the difficulty as defined by polls for each game.  Trophy hunters vote for the average. I don't know what else you want to define it. 
kongburrito,"I'm looking to pick up the last of us,  I haven't experienced it yet, and it sounds like a game that will define the last console generation"
kongburrito,"I liked the second, but I think the third greatly improved the good things from the second. The new movement options and tehter shenanigans made it really fun to destroy things in unconventional ways. I'd recommend it."
kongburrito,I'd encourage you to earn the trophy yourself. I think youll find it far more rewarding!
kongburrito,We always bought or pulled pork frozen and let chef knock out some bomb ass sides
kongburrito,"Haha,  thanks. 
I've been actively hunting trophies for a while now.  It's all about having fun for me,  and I'm able to enjoy playing bad games that are easy too.

I actually just bought the Japanese version of Arkham Asylum, my 6th platinum, so that I could re experience it all over again. 

Happy hunting! "
kongburrito,"Yeah, there are communities built around it. A lot of it comes from a drive to show off your completed games to fellow gamers."
kongburrito,"Mortal Kombat Vita Platinum

Yeah, 24 hours, 100 wins, 100 fatalities, 150 x-rays, 10,000 pints of blood spilled for every character. Glad I did it for my 100th platinum, but never again."
kongburrito,"The dream :(
My current sponsor is generally the fast food place I go before events. Next tournament I want to be sponsored by Chipoltle."
kongburrito,People who don't know what NaCl is try to call me Nackle G. Good stuff man!
kongburrito,"NaClG

My initials are CLG. You guys know what the NaCl is"
kongburrito,"This seems fueled by a political agenda more than a drive to explain a theory. 
"
kongburrito,Arkham Night!
kongburrito,This is an extremely fun trophy. I suggest getting it that third point.
kongburrito,"The ones you've described are more ""eastern VN"" while the ones op described are more Western.  Do you think that someone who likes one will like the other?  I haven't dipped my feet into eastern yet"
kongburrito,Not the definitive edition for me.  The opportunity was definitive
kongburrito,Well I hope you are successful in the future.  Let me know if you want help routing and such.  Though there is not much.
kongburrito,"Plus you gotta get that good last boss speech choice. 
Good god this game was so bad.  "
kongburrito,"Also the noms for being a team member and such are in a seperate category,  that is not needed for the platinum. "
kongburrito,"There's a difference between a game being hard to last
Plat and being unachievable due to servers.  Lost Planet two is a crazy outlier, and a known one at that. 

Kill x enemies trophies happen as you play a game.  Look at guantlet for example.  I had to kill 15k of six enemy types.  Lots of people see it as a grind,  I saw it come naturally as I played levels with my friends"
kongburrito,"So if your account is activated as a primary on that ps4, other accounts on the same ps4 can access the games it buys, as well as access online features. 

If it isn't a primary,  you can only play games from your account when logged in on your profile.

Let me know if you have any questions. "
kongburrito,It bugged for me at a puzzle yesterday
kongburrito,"Very few games have that trophy.  Sometimes they are hard or time consuming,  but you find that of you enjoy a game,  the time will happen quick. "
kongburrito,"As many as I can.  I try to get a lot of the 100%s too. 

115 plattys and counting"
kongburrito,How much faster would ng plus be with the permanent stat upgrades you can get in game? 
kongburrito,"Man,  I'm going to tell you a secret. 

I haven't played persona 4 golden because disgaea left a bad taste in my mouth on vita rpgs. I don't understand half the posts here"

kongburrito,"If you like it play borderlands one,  I'd personally avoid the pre sequel "
kongburrito,"To me the story is secondary,  and borderlands 2 stands on its own just fine"
kongburrito,"You said fps but uncharted and the last of us are both third person shooters. 

Fps I recommend borderlands 1 and 2"

kongburrito,"I am a trophy hunter,  meaning I collect the achievements from video games on Sony consoles. 

The sound that it makes when you collect a trophy is great! "
kongburrito,"Check out psnprofiles, you can do most of those things there.

I keep a spreadsheet for games I haven't loaded on my list yet"
kongburrito,"I'm playing through this game right now.

Half of it feels like a mediocre shooter, half of it feels like a stumbling simulator"
kongburrito,"Curious about your spread sheet,  what's that about?  :)"
kongburrito,"He said it perfectly. 
I paid but the game was short, sweet,  and didn't over stay its welcome
"
kongburrito,It's a point and click Game laced with book references
kongburrito,I'm starting the ps3 version soon.  You could always make a boosting session for the multilayer trophies
kongburrito,"6 hours of playtime, using a guide after the main story. Nothing missable, but I would avoid getting collectables so you can follow a guide all the way through rather than figuring what you missed"
kongburrito,The games are the deadly tower of monsters and borderlands the pre-sequel ps4
kongburrito,"I'm writing the trophy guide still, so it will be compiled this weekends. 
Is there certain monster type you need? "
kongburrito,"For the Remix bosses, I'll write a short guide here;


Khidr
Khidr has three different base attacks, from what I remember. He can either do a windmill pattern, a random pattern, or he will shoot organized shots. Your character is a spellsword, to put out damage you should be utilizing your empowered spell (triangle) before he shoots, then using the down time between attakcs to get attacks in and recharge mana. This fight is probably the second hardest of the remix bosses. (EDIT) You can use the empowered spell right below Neo Khidr, and it will continue to hit him. Its a great option to throw two empowered spells down, then continue to dodge.


Alexander
Alexander is the hardest remix boss in my opinion. Your character has lots of extra jumps, so utilize your movement to avoid him and the smaller skulls. You can use the hokages special skill to jump between halves of the board. While killing the small skulls should not be a priority, managing their numbers is extremely important to success in this battle. It is worth noting that getting hit by the spikes on the side of the level gives you the same invulnerability as being hit by any other attack, but does about a third less damage. I ended the battle by standing on the spikes on the bottom (taking periodic damage) while wailing on Alexander.


Ponce De Leon
Ponce is the third hardest boss. You have limited movement options, but you should be conscious of the jumps and dashes available. As a barbarian in this battle, I believe you have access to three shouts, which can be used to remove fireballs in an area around you. These should be utilized only when you think you cannot take damage. I thought this boss was pretty easy in the strategy department, as it is generally one hit, dash backwards, rinse repeat. Going in a large circle slowly around the entire map (find the pace that works for you) will allow you to make a full circle as fireballs dissappear. On the top platforms, do not forget you have the option to drop through, which will present you with a good escape option.


Herodotus
By far the easiest boss battle (perhaps in the game). Focus on one blob at a time, and avoid making too many small ones. I was able to complete this battle on the first try.


BROHANNES!
He'll offer you a little trouble, but you should definetly take advantage of the incredible class they give you. You have a couple jumps and dashes, so be aware of your movement options. Your character also has hypergonadism, which is very helpful for spacing out the bosses. By camping on one side of the arena, you can bait out one of the bros at a time, getting in a hypergonad hit, knocking them back. If you ever feel over approached, you can use the dagger spell to limit the brothers movement options to jump approaches. I don’t recall if you get axes or swords as your triangle spell. If it is axes, avoid using them, as they will only be a mana sink. If it is the sword, use it to limit the bros movement options on you."
kongburrito,Let me see if I can dig up the strategy guide I wrote
kongburrito,"I can give you tips, but in the end you can totally do it yourself. Shareplay is too laggy to successfully
 beat the bosses."
kongburrito,"Here in flint there are lots of ways for us to get access to water, but it's way to little to late"
kongburrito,Velocity 2x is fun. I wish I could play that for the first time again
kongburrito,"Oh yeah,  that book had invisibility,  the aoe spell I described,  and the vacuum like spell.  Between going invisible,  allowing enemies,  and canceling them out of every attack with the vacuum you can live forever"
kongburrito,Why do 10% of the users own 90% of the plats. Wake up America! 
kongburrito,"That is good,  but the ice beam is necessary for specific afk grinds,  due to the larger enemies.

But yeah double tap O for a ridiculous aoe attack that can slow enemies.  It's stupid"
kongburrito,"That is good,  but the ice beam is necessary for specific afk grinds,  due to the larger enemies.

But yeah double tap O for a ridiculous aoe attack that can slow enemies.  It's stupid"
kongburrito,"Yeah.  They only one you can't do is cultists,  but you can grind about 120 ish a minute with the wizard.  The afk grind for orcs is extremely slow but you can get about the 4000 an hour with the start I used. But these strats only work with the wizard so I suggest starting with him for that reason.

Buy his last book asap, as it is extremely powerful for grinds and survival"
kongburrito,"Play the wizard. 
He is probably the best character,  and for the kill grinds you want to use him as he has the afk strategies and the highest dps. Using him for the base game will get you about halfway on the grinds, and I promise you'll want to afk some of them.

The warrior is probably the worst character,  and I think he is the least fun.  Every other character has a unique mechanic,  and he is just mashing  square, with the occasional charge. 

There are a couple levels that are best for grinding . I'm putting together a guide on psnprofiles this weekend. "
kongburrito,"I did the main game with a team of three local coop.
I did the survival solo with the wizard. I 
I did the grind solo with the wizard. 

Man this game is really fun,  but I promise the kills trophy will over stay their welcome.  Doing the trophies efficiently overlaps with boring on a couple enemy type kill grinds 


"
kongburrito,"Well it was meant to say plat 110.
Oh well"
kongburrito,"I was going to post this one.  I think this for the first week of a month would be great.  
In addition,  is love to see a monthly ""best trophy this month"" thread,  so everyone can show off their best accomplishment of the month. I think an open comments section in a sticky is more likely to get conversation."
kongburrito,"So we don't sign up with our teams,  we play with people you assign is?  That seems as goofy as giving us AI..."
kongburrito,"There is a trophy for killing friends, so you need a friend to kill or a second controller
"
kongburrito,"I know which level,  I just can't seem to get both orcs and Grunts to aggro me right"
kongburrito,"Hey,  how did you grind Orcs and Grunts? I'm really hoping you can afk them but I don't know where"
kongburrito,Good ones. I'll have to search through my ps4 ones for funny pictures soon
kongburrito,"While not a traditional set, I think Mango vs. Baddies shows how good a top player is.

He is beating players that aren't great, but are interested enough in competitive play to show up to a tournament. And he's not just beating them, he is demolishing them sometimes.

kongburrito,"Hey,  are you in the us? I'd love to buy the Japanese version when you are done with it."
kongburrito,"I have this too, not hard."
kongburrito,"Add me,  dgaustin.  We're still looking around.  Do you have a mic? "
kongburrito,"I think the game is fun, but I wish they stole the fun leveling system from Guantlet Dark Legacy. After knocking out the campaign, story, and some of the daily challenges, there is not a whole lot left to do. There's no replayability factor."
kongburrito,"USA, USA!

Thanks for the game! The art is amazing :)"
kongburrito,What system? 
kongburrito,"God, it was astonishing that the game was that bad. Like, it was all there to be good.
And then they made it.

AND WHAT WAS THE PLOT?!"
kongburrito,"Grats on GW3, I'm working on the Ps4 version now. Which version did you happen to knock out?"
kongburrito,"Yep. Most of the time I do it and enjoy the purchase though, so I don't really feel like I'm simply paying for the 100%."
kongburrito,Which part are you stuck on?
kongburrito,Really? I've watched a decent number of games and havent caught it! I'll keep an eye out for it.
kongburrito,"That hit through the stage by Axe was cool, I haven't seen something like that before."
kongburrito,"Lol, I switch between being Mich PM and NC PM, though I havent been to a tourney in a bit. No offense taken. I play a fraudulent Zelda and people that I beat should feel bad."
kongburrito,"Yo if Karma reads this I'm gonna spit it real, so this is a trigger warning.

And Kai is better. I can take a set of Karma."
kongburrito,"Yo Sharkz is a great NC Ice Climber player. 

Gato is a top Game and Watch player in NC, but I don't know if he is top five yet.
Archer is NC's top link. Jelly is the top Meta Knight. I think these guys are close.

It's worth stating that Gato Jelly and Sharkz all did very well at the PM side tourney at BH5, taking some sets off of great players.

Also lol no one mains Zelda put me on that. Not really, hail Whitecrow.

"
kongburrito,"If the other guy doesn't get you,  I'm happy to help "
kongburrito,"I'll add you now. I need the c laptrap trophy, so if you would do that with me it be great"

kongburrito,"Hey there. Sounds like you have some pretty strong opinions about the games.
Why don't you tell us WHY you dislike the games, rather than just bashing them. Currently your comment seems to be lacking anything that contributes to discussion.

Remember, you pay for playstation plus. Some people don't see the complete value in the service. It's always your choice to unsubscribe if you do not see value."
kongburrito,Skip it. I really didn't enjoy it and I was a fanatic of the first two.
kongburrito,"Oh yeah we do!
"
kongburrito,"This is the case. It's a common issue for people that pick up an asian game on vita, then can't get the regional dlc"
kongburrito,"Friday it is,  add me on psn."
kongburrito,Which game?
kongburrito,"If you're interested in knocking out the DLC's with me, I'd be happy to do this.
"
kongburrito,"I'm pretty close to level 50 myself. If I get there soon, I'll power level you. Can you message me this weekend?"
kongburrito,"I felt like the game could have offered a ""creative"" mode where the automatic pull from the vines was negated. I didn't watch the vote trailer, but I can see how it be dissappointing to hear about a feature like that then not have it implemented in game."
kongburrito,"I think one of the things I learned was there are lots of alternatives to climbing. Often when I fell, I would ride a vine(s) back to where I needed to go."
kongburrito,"Perhaps discuss why you fel that? That's a pretty bold statement, considering we got Rocket League, Ground Zeroes, and one of my favorites, Guacamelee. I haven't touched STFU, but I liked Grow Home for what it is worth. No, not a GOTY, but a fun game none the less."
kongburrito,"I love the points you made! I agree with you on almost everything. I disagree with the point of Uplay. I think cosmetic features in Uplay is great, but adding in a freaking GAME MECHANIC is ridiculous in my eyes. I just felt like I was being forced a bit into that mechanic. "
kongburrito,"I'll start with Grow Home.

I enjoyed this game, it was very much like a vertical QWOP. I like that movement really changed from the start to the end of the game. It was short, but I think that benefits it as the concept would get old if it were a couple hours longer.

I really disliked the fact that to get the radar that made the hundred percent more sensible, you had to utilize UPLAY. I would have preferred to see the radar unlock at 50-60% of the shards unlocked. It felt like a cheap usage of their slow laggy menu feature. "
kongburrito,"I knocked this one out when the servers were alive enough that I could consistently get atleast 1-2 full servers. I think I only did around 250 races, as there was only one person that could contest me, and he wasn't on a lot. I found the combat to be pretty easy, but only if you were in a lobby where people went between an attack pad or two on a short length of track rather than actually racing around.

I had fun with it, but I agree with you. Never. Again. Grats on the Ultra Rare platty :)"
kongburrito,"Fun:
Ratchet&gt;Sly&gt;Jak

Jak&gt;Ratchet&gt;Sly"
kongburrito,"Okay,  I might try a different approach next month. 
Perhaps a me gathered with 6 high level comments, one for each game.  From there people can begin discussion on any game at any time. 

I'll sit on your other point for now"
kongburrito,I'll work on this this weekend. 
kongburrito,"I really recommend PSNProfiles, as it seems to be the trophy card site with the most members right now."
kongburrito,"Congrats :) 
Persistence is key :)"
kongburrito,"It sounds like he enjoyed the art style also. And perhaps the gameplay. I'm not tired of them, but I really enjoyed Teslagrad"
kongburrito,With latency I don't think I could pull it off. Where are you located? US?
kongburrito,"He said people that play kids games for easy trophies are pathetic,  roughly. "
kongburrito,"Maybe the hunt is enjoyable for some people.  I've played inherently bad games with my roommates that became fun through our banter
"
kongburrito,"Dude,  play nice. 
Just because you got up on the wrong side of the bed doesn't mean you have to attack others or attempt to belittle people's achievements. "
kongburrito,If I want to play an easy game for trophies I will.  Enjoyment is not always mutually exclusive from ease. 
kongburrito,"Hey man, I can't do this right now, but if you let me work on this tonight, we can figure it out. Do you have a skype? 
"
kongburrito,"Yeah, you can do tags to get 2 characters done at a time. There are a couple small ways to boost this but I learned them later :("
kongburrito,"U call him a fuck boy you fuccboi?

Doot doot mthrfakr, no calcium 4 u

Thanks Mr. Skeltal"
kongburrito,I figured that this post would be the same as the announcement post.
kongburrito,"dgaustin
"
kongburrito,"But the great lengths is fun to us. 
I played 768 hours of Mortal Kombat for a damn trophy. It was a lot of my time, but at the end I enjoyed it, and the feeling of getting that trophy to pop was so great. A lot of trophy hunters only play the games they want to, and often trophies will extend the longevity of enjoyment for a game."
kongburrito,"Or people can buy the game because it worked fine on every other system. I feel like its goofy to blame them for a bad outsourced port.

I'll be buying it because I enjoyed the forest one,  and people can spend their money however"
kongburrito,Congrats! Are you new to trophy hunting?  What is your psn?
kongburrito,Or wouldn't surprise me.  A lot of games go on sale before being on plus. Games that have dlc they can sell you are also common. That's how saints row 3 got me.  Driveclub going on plus fully means more potential dlc butters
kongburrito,"I have completed 103 games to platinum. The thing about it is,  there's nothing wrong with purchasing a game from another region or on another console.  If you want to pay the game again and get more trophies,  it's their money. 

I've played a couple ""easy kids games""
I play them with my room mates. I play,  they drink and we just have a good time shooting the shit over a generic game. Playing for trophies has brought me to play games I didn't expect to like (teslagrad, neveralone, xeodrifter, cabelas games) To me,  experiencing a lot of new games outside of my comfort zone is worth playing a bad,  but enjoyable,  game every once in a while"
kongburrito,"Surprised you liked Teslagrad but disliked xeodrifter. While there areobvious differences,  and I agree Teslagrad was better,  I thought Xeodrifter was worth the play.  The speed run trophy was challenging,  and I thought there was fun and value in finding all the secrets"
kongburrito,I was looking at the additional DLC! Glad you were able to get it though!
kongburrito,"Hey, add me on Psn, I've been meaning to finish this game up.
"
kongburrito,"Its very Metroid-esc (and has a very clear metroid reference)
"
kongburrito,"Nothing too hard about them. Most of them may take a few tries, but all in all the hardest part was locating them."
kongburrito,I absolutely would. I really loved the game!
kongburrito,"I'll start off by saying I really enjoyed Xeodrifter. I'm working on the speedrun tonight, but the first playthrough was extremely fun. It's a very short game, and like Teslagrad, it doesn't feel like it overstays it's welcome. I played it on PS4, so I can't comment on how it runs on the Vita. Excited to give it a go though!"
kongburrito,"Its a puzzle platformer, but I really like the magnet mechanics. The genre hasn't worn thin on me so I really enjoyed it."
kongburrito,The game is easy. The game is short. The game is fun. You do not have to complete the game for the plat. It doesn't surprise me it isn't rare in the slightest. 
kongburrito,"24 hrs with all 32 characters. 
However,  it ended up being about three to four hours for each character. Since I didn't really online boost. I did master my favorite character without boosting.  I played a lot of online before it was shut down. "
kongburrito,Does share play work for you? Is your internet good enough?
kongburrito,"""Yes actually this is an offer. I received an e-mail from sony with a code for 1 bonus month if you buy 3 months. I'm glad that they gave it to you even without entering a code.""

Fucking theives. Who does OP think he is."
kongburrito,"This is a good post, and you kind of come off as a jerk. 
He's looking to see if anyone else has gotten this bonus month. Since he has gotten it twice, perhaps others can recreate it and save some money on their memberships also."
kongburrito,"You have to reach level 25 with Clap trap and play with him in Co-op. Our team's clap trap got it when he hit level 25. You have to respec with him a  couple times,  but nothing about it is hard/"
kongburrito,I am. Please verify you can use share play first
kongburrito,Oh. Isnt it level 5+ also?
kongburrito,PSNTL only records people who has signed up with an account. They have some different stats for trophy values based on rarities too.
kongburrito,I have a galaxy S3 if that matters. Every time I load the page it will load up but attempting to click any link will crash the internet.
kongburrito,I know it has three different lists. I figure I'll find out if it is cross save or not when I get it.
kongburrito,"I Just wish player pages didn't crash my internet on mobile so much.

Really like the system :)"
kongburrito,"I enjoy all the games I get trophies in. If I was playing a game I didn't enjoy, I would probably be a trophy whore. 

I say trophy hunter because: I enjoy playing bad games.

It's fun to see how important game design is and how small things can completely ruin a otherwise decent game. It's fun to crack open a couple brews with my roommates and plat a shitty game. I enjoy it."
kongburrito,"Alright. I'll probably buy ps3 since its digital only and rent vita and ps4
"
kongburrito,"Haha. I'm a trophy hunter, so three plats for the price of one sounds fine to me!"
kongburrito,Yeah. I'm so happy to finally be done with it.
kongburrito,Jive turkey or Home run in The Shoot. Freaking impossible bronzes. Give perfect bat swings in a motion controlled minigame or three strikes when bowling through the obstacles
kongburrito,"This is it for me guys. After about 2.5 years, I'll be getting my Mortal Kombat platinum trophy this week. This will be my **100th** platinum. This trophy has takena  lot of dedication for me, as for each of the 32 characters it requires:

* 100 Kills
* 100 Fatalities
* 150 X-Rays Landed
* 10000 Pints of Blood Spilled
* 24 hrs of playtime

I'm really excited to finish MK and move on to a new game on my list. :)"
kongburrito,"I think it's a really good idea, but the transfer to reddit formatting is incredibly hard to read. If you could utilize a google doc spreadsheet so that we can see it in it's natural habitat, it be awesome to see those stats!"
kongburrito,I think some better formatting is really needed.
kongburrito,"There is no save transfer.

However, the second time around you'll find the plat will take you considerably less time if you decide to buy it for both."
kongburrito,"Word. I wish they atleast gave the option to utilize it in SS or FL. 

That being said, I think that remote play saves the vita for me.
"
kongburrito,"Well it's freaking awesome.
I seriously love it. My girlfriend doesn't like very many games but was able to sit down and enjoy this one with me because of the art! "
kongburrito,Theives in Time is the only game I know that even bothered trying.
kongburrito,"I can help you knock out Super Exploding Zoo.  Add me at dgaustin.

For Tigerwoods 2013, the online is shut down.

Fifa Street has one glitched trophy called ""Making New Friends."" The EA server hub was broken or removed. sorry. It seems like there used to be a work around, but I have no idea if it will work for you."
kongburrito,"Vanquish.
Vanquish Vanquish Vanquish.

The make or break trophy is completing all tactical challenges (or challenge #6). By rarity the trophies for this game are 
Platinum (2.74%)
Complete all Challenges (2.79%)
Find all hidden collectables (7.75%)

This trophy is incredibly hard, and definitely makes Vanquish a platinum to be proud of."
kongburrito,Yesterday
kongburrito,"Holy cow! You did the art for this game? 
Ughhh it is so good! I loved all the enviornments, I love the characters so much too. Seriously, everything in this game works together perfectly. Serious kudos."
kongburrito,"Yeah, unfortunately
"
kongburrito,"Nice! As a fellow 99 plat player, good luck dude!
"
kongburrito,"I really want to recommend Teslagrad. It's a short puzzle platformer that utilizes magnetism mechanics. New mechanics are introduced at the right times, and puzzles never get dull. Each room feels different, and the game benefits for never getting same-y. "
kongburrito,You can't say the graphics of Rocket League and Super Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars are the same. Rocket league has considerably better graphics.
kongburrito,Fair enough. The value is there for some of us and not there for others.
kongburrito,Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
kongburrito,"Teslagrad is awesome, I highly recommend it. It's short, sweet, and fresh the entire time. I never felt that it was boring or the puzzles were becoming too ""same-y"""
kongburrito,"I feel like it is one thing to say that the games aren't your favorite and another to say all these titles could be run on PS2. Rocket League, MGS:V, First Light are next gen titles that utilize the power the PS4 had that the previous gen didnt"
kongburrito,But it was only free for Vita? I didn't think it was free on all systems it was released on. Maybe I am wrong.
kongburrito,"I didn't want to put my reaction in the highest level comment. 
I really loved Teslagrad. It's a short puzzle platformer. Being short is not a fault here. The ideas stay fresh, the enviornments are new, and nothing feels drawn out. The game could have been longer, but if it was, its length would hinder it.

I hope Twisted Metal being on plus will give us a trophy fix, if the game hasn't been fixed since I last looked into it...."
kongburrito,It may not be free for Vita? This has happened before (Geometry Wars)

kongburrito,"Yeah dude
My PSN is dgaustin
"
kongburrito,A lot of the time it was resetting the game. Or reloading from a checkpoint. But it completely ruined the flow of the game. It was just such a disappointing experience.
kongburrito,"The plats are Minecraft and Saints Row IV
The 100%'s are Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris and Dragon Fantasy Book 1.

The only one out of these I would not recommend is Temple of Osiris. That game was atrociously buggy, and it really ruined my experience with it. Saints Row IV was buggy, but it didn't really ruin the game, because the content was fun. I would recommend Saints Row The Third over this one though."
kongburrito,"I'd reccommend The Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us Instead. Those games are actually enjoyable, and you get the plats just as easily."
kongburrito,"That's a really good point that I didn't really think about. I guess they don't utilize that on New Releases because they really can't. Based on last month, they have no qualms with games that border the +70 (MouseCraft, Styx, Rain). I think that Entwined was a new release."
kongburrito,This is an arbitray rule in my eyes. I don't think Sony really utilizes it anymore.
kongburrito,"Not unless it has wifi capabilities, but even then it may not run the website you need correctly (jackbox.tv)
"
kongburrito,"The second mission on the DLC I think.

When you get to the end and you have to kill the Dominatrix. If you don't activate the terminal, you will have infinitely spawning enemies. This is by far the easiest place to obtain the kill trophies. For the 25 warden kills, just go to the military island, and start shooting people. Aliens will quickly spawn and at max noteriety Wardens will begin spawning."
kongburrito,"A lot of people think its run out now. Zombie Vikings is at the bottom of the list for free games, and a lot of people are just tired of zombies."
kongburrito,"KK, im home, prob on for next 6 hrs"
kongburrito,Yeah. That game is a hit on the Xbox/PS right now. It's my go to game for large parties.
kongburrito,"Awesome :D

I'm sure you've played Ratchet and Clank. But if you haven't, while they focus on combat, I really think they excel in awesome platforming too."
kongburrito,"Yooka Laylee hit a stretch goal and will be on the PS4. A spiritual successor to Banjo Kazooie, and right down the alley of the ""collectathon"" genre. I loved Spyro and BK as a kid, so I'm super excited for Yooka Laylee."
kongburrito,"Do you think you could sell The Last of Us to someone with a similar description? 
""Oh it's another zombie game, where you play as this guy and Ellen Page."" 

I think at the end of the day, the narrative and gameplay will speak for the success, not the premise.
"
kongburrito,"A lot of people have been saying that it is not difficult. Every single trophy appears to be walkthroughable. If you enjoy a game with lots of exploration to watch a story unfold, I could see someone recommending this.

It looks very atmosphere heavy, which is the reason I want to get it. I love being sucked into an immersive gaming atmosphere."
kongburrito,Are you free tonight? I can try to put a little bit of effort into them.
kongburrito,"Got it, thanks for the explanation!"
kongburrito,"And PC's generally detect and automatically adjust resolution to most monitors? I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, I've been spoiled with a laptop."
kongburrito,"A lot of my friends don't own gaming PCs, but enjoy gaming. Same as how a lot of my friends didn't own a console. Just offers those that don't have their own rig an opportunity to play and some time to dick around with friends"
kongburrito,"Thanks!
I utilize Co-optimus a lot for my console, I was just concerned with how easy it is to plug and play a pc co-op game. I appreciate it :)"
kongburrito,Thanks for the honest response.
kongburrito,"Between a single and multi-monitor set up, is there a difference in set up time?"
kongburrito,"Thank you. If it is possible to use just one computer to force split screen (or maybe even dual monitors, with a player on each) that be very cool."
kongburrito,"Thanks for the answer. I currently am a PS3/PS4 owner. I know the PS3 controller wasn't as easily supported (although I've gotten it to work before), but I've heard the Dualshock 4 has better support. Do you know if that is true?
"
kongburrito,"I have no idea, that's why I was asking.
But with a larger gaming rig, I don't know how hard it is to take a tower and move it between monitors. One of the things I like about my console is the ability to plug and play. I plug it into a monitor and it is good to go. I have basically 0 knowledge of computers capabilities to do this."
kongburrito,"How long did this game take you? I have an opportunity to pick it up, but I'm not dying to do more grinding."
kongburrito,"I've got all but one trophy (saving it for a reason)
There is very little skill beyond the flapmaster trophy. It basically requires a score of 10 in a flappy bird rip off with god awful hit detection. But even that only took me about 30-60 minutes. Everything else can be acheived easily with a walkthrough or through untimed/unrestricted exploration."
kongburrito,"I think you get points for revives. This was my second platinum trophy, and I know for a fact that I did it co-op. "
kongburrito,Maybe next time dude :)
kongburrito,"I like to use GameFlip, you can generally undersale GameStop by a dollar or two and get a sale. It's an app on your phone. All my purchases and sales have gone well enough."
kongburrito,"This is how I got it last night. I generally found that if I focuse on the bottom of the barrier, I can utilize that to time my jump. If I am at the peak of a jump when I enter the gap, I jump when I hit the middle. If I am coming down from a jump as I enter the gap, I will have to jump at both of the white lines. The timing is tricky but I really recommend this process. 

Ended up taking me a little under an hour I think. I'd have to look at my trophies though."
kongburrito,"For future reference, it's cool if you put the name of the game in the title too. That way people don't have to load the picture to congratulate you or ask about the game!"
kongburrito,"Add me, dgaustin. I have the plat and managed to beat these guys before. I'll put a little effort towards it before. Which ones are you stuck on?"
kongburrito,I certainly hope you don't have a twenty hour shift
kongburrito,I work from 7-5 as an engineer at drug discovery product factory. So we make pipets and petri dishes and stuff.
kongburrito,"I'm sorry but I'm going to sound like a butt here. 
Maybe just earn the trophy naturally. The feeling of me getting an aerial goal and hearing the trophy pop was awesome. It's not easy but this was a rewarding trophy"
kongburrito,"Not sure if this is the case in Smash 4, but in PM and Melee, weight and fall speed are different. Fall speed generally means it is harder to kill a character off the top. Fox being a fast faller means he is particular hard to kill off the top. A move that kills a floaty character that is the same weight may not necessarily kill fox."
kongburrito,"I played with three friends via internet and had multiple issues with exploding balls going into the ground and not exploding. It was just really boring to repeat sections.

Did this really get down voted? I have an honest opinion of the game after five or six hours of play. Jeez louise people"
kongburrito,"Temple of Osiris was fun, but holy cow is it glitchy. I played with 3 other friends, and while the experience was really good, we all got tired of resetting a level because a key piece (rolling exploding ball) had gone through the floor. Or when we finally got it through an entire puzzle, it refused to explode at the door.

The game is fun but really unpolished, and unfortunately that takes a lot of it away from me.

Edit: So I played it again last night with the same friends. We encountered a bug where a pushable object did not allow us to grab it. We ended up knocking the ball off the level, and the one that spawned in its place was grabbable. We had an issue where we complete a level, get the end level cut scene, go to the end of level area, and upon leaving are presented with the end of level cutscene again. The game completely froze on a loading screen, requiring us all to back out and rejoin the game. 

Edit 2: So I got the 100% in this game. I encountered so many glitches. On the Tomb of The Torturer, we would randomly die when we were rolling on safe flat ground. After we all completed a boss in a time limit, only one person got the speedrun challenge. The game repeatedly removed my minigun. Fireballs randomly became impossible to grab. This game is buggy, and suffers because of it."
kongburrito,"I agree, this one was satisfying! However, Spec Ops is a TPS, not an FPS."
kongburrito,"I'm in again

kongburrito,"If someone told me I could rent a total of  72 games a year for 50$,i would do that. Hell even twenty four games a year is still plenty of playtime without spending to much money"

kongburrito,These sound shapes trophies come from a cloud save. I earned all of the platinums using a previous save from the game.
kongburrito,"I enjoyed the experiences of all of them. Magus is a reminder how a good concept can quickly be ruined by really poor execution. While it was a (sort of) fun game, it lacked a lot of  things it needed to make it a quality one. At the end of the day, the only part I didn't enjoy was grinding the last level for a trophy. 

Sound shapes was fun, three free plats and a little boost to my trophy score.

Cabela's Adventure Camp was easy and stupid fun. I really enjoyed going through it with my roommates and talking shit about the game. A poor quality game with high quality friends made it a good experience with a bad game."
kongburrito,"No he shouldn't. He played the game,  he earned the trophy. 
I played this game yesterday too.  It wasn't the worst,  but me and my roommates had fun making fun of it.  While the gameplay was bad the experience wasn't. "

kongburrito,"I beat it in 11 deaths in just a little over two hours.
If you haven't played through new game ++ yet, do that. Getting used to dodging an excess amount of enemies and bullets will prepare you for the playthrough.

Go slow, and pick the right upgrades. I suggest beating Khidr on your first life, and restarting if you dont (unless you do exceptionally well). I was able to clear out the castle area with every single descendant, to get a little extra gold for each run. 

For upgrades, go for health, armor, and strength. Avoid purchasing new classes that you dont want (COUGH COUGH MINER). While the spellsword class is good, I dont think it is worth the cash investment it takes.

Finally, if you dont want to back up your saves, you can still cheese this trophy. If you find the clown in the castle, and he offers to play the dagger game with you, quitting before the resolution of the game (before you through your last knife) will net you the extra gold, but you will not get penalized at all. I was able to farm about 2-300 a run from this, but it got sort of boring...
TAKE IT SLOW. 

"
kongburrito,"Yeah, along those lines. I got through multiple new games before I bothered going for -15 deaths. You really need to get used to dodging the hard ones, and dodging the easy ones are a breeze. I managed to win with only 11 heirs. 

I also suggest beating the remix bosses after a new game +, so you are more comfortable with your character movement."
kongburrito,"For sure, happy to help! I am adding a little more to Khidr"
kongburrito,That's what I thought originally.  I managed to learn how to beat neo khidr and take the win.  I can upload my strategies but I'm sure other people have better guides already
kongburrito,I'd love to enter your world and get sine off those trophies. 
kongburrito,"Edit: if you need any help with something I dint cover here,  pm our reply


What part of the game are you stuck on?

For the Remix bosses, I'll write a short guide here;

 

 

Khidr

 

Khidr has three different base attacks, from what I remember. He can either do a windmill pattern, a random pattern, or he will shoot organized shots. Your character is a spellsword, to put out damage you should be utilizing your empowered spell (triangle) before he shoots, then using the down time between attakcs to get attacks in and recharge mana. This fight is probably the second hardest of the remix bosses. (EDIT) You can use the empowered spell right below Neo Khidr, and it will continue to hit him. Its a great option to throw two empowered spells down, then continue to dodge.

 

 

Alexander

 

Alexander is the hardest remix boss in my opinion. Your character has lots of extra jumps, so utilize your movement to avoid him and the smaller skulls. You can use the hokages special skill to jump between halves of the board. While killing the small skulls should not be a priority, managing their numbers is extremely important to success in this battle. It is worth noting that getting hit by the spikes on the side of the level gives you the same invulnerability as being hit by any other attack, but does about a third less damage. I ended the battle by standing on the spikes on the bottom (taking periodic damage) while wailing on Alexander.

 

 

Ponce De Leon

 

Ponce is the third hardest boss. You have limited movement options, but you should be conscious of the jumps and dashes available. As a barbarian in this battle, I believe you have access to three shouts, which can be used to remove fireballs in an area around you. These should be utilized only when you think you cannot take damage. I thought this boss was pretty easy in the strategy department, as it is generally one hit, dash backwards, rinse repeat. Going in a large circle slowly around the entire map (find the pace that works for you) will allow you to make a full circle as fireballs dissappear. On the top platforms, do not forget you have the option to drop through, which will present you with a good escape option.

 

 

Herodotus

 

By far the easiest boss battle (perhaps in the game). Focus on one blob at a time, and avoid making too many small ones. I was able to complete this battle on the first try.

 

 

BROHANNES!

 

He'll offer you a little trouble, but you should definetly take advantage of the incredible class they give you. You have a couple jumps and dashes, so be aware of your movement options. Your character also has hypergonadism, which is very helpful for spacing out the bosses. By camping on one side of the arena, you can bait out one of the bros at a time, getting in a hypergonad hit, knocking them back. If you ever feel over approached, you can use the dagger spell to limit the brothers movement options to jump approaches. I don’t recall if you get axes or swords as your triangle spell. If it is axes, avoid using them, as they will only be a mana sink. If it is the sword, use it to limit the bros movement options on you."
kongburrito,"I'm happy to beat any of the remix boss for you.  Add me on pan, dgaustin"
kongburrito,I put a lot of hours in on the weekends. I don't have school right now and I live away from any family and friends. 
kongburrito,"I have a lot of fun playing these games to completion.  I don't see it as a chore,  And I don't only play for trophies. Honestly,  if you don't like trophies, you don't have to go for them or be in this sub. Personal preference on goals in games man"
kongburrito,"I ended up beating it with eleven children. I beat Khadir and Ponce on my first life, I was able to beat Alexander as soon as I had vampirism and a  little more health to spare. For the blob ( I forgot his name...) I used a hokage with double jumps so that I could avoid all of the little blobs. Theres definitely some strategy involved...

The final boss is tricky, but getting a barbarian king helped, because I could spare so many hits.

The upgrades were easy enough, you generally just want to avoid buying new classes, except the hokage, imo. Upgrading health and weight is important, as equipment provides quick stats for you."
kongburrito,"I'm curious too, I haven't been able to act that quick out of tele yet..."
kongburrito,Ill also note i was 12th fastest to get the first light plat :)
kongburrito,Put me in coach!
kongburrito,"The level two bosses give you a set character,  so it isn't about progression but more based on strategy.  Let me know if you want tips on those,  as they can be tricky to approach. 

After new game +2, the enemies don't upgrade, so the game levels off a little bit. "

not really,  but Damn was that a steal"
kongburrito,"We need to be able to upgrade melee damage faster as well as upgrade mana replenish speed (perhaps through clicks to promote ""active"" play)"
kongburrito,"I feel like your game limits for no reason. 
I was really looking forward to getting hundreds of little small guys and combining them all the way up to a larger one. Instead I get told there is a max of 16. What's the purpose. My phone can handle it,  it just limits the play styles. 

I also feel like the coins per second is inconsistent with what I actually receive.  

The super pooper bar should probably also be affected by tapping.  Taps feel inconsistent as far as effectiveness,  and purchasing increases really quickly so it limits game speed. 

Awesome idea,  buy I think it lacks a diverse way to play the game"
kongburrito,This would be the spot I was looking for it to be.
kongburrito,178 please!
kongburrito,"He's good, and doesn't really camp. But I stand by saying that he is boring to watch. When he does start the arrows, it is over and over and over. His kills are always him just walking another character out of the blast zone. I don't really respect his play because of the game he played with Wizzy in florida. "
kongburrito,"I always hate watching him play. His games seem really stale, and i cant really respect him as a player after the john he pulled with wizzy in florida"
kongburrito,"Thanks. I really enjoyed it, I think the difficulty is a little over hyped though"

kongburrito,Can you imagine Jetpack Joyride boosting its memory size with garbage to be eligible for a plat.
kongburrito,"I have this plat, and I thought that the last level was the only hard one, as soon as you understand the control scheme and level layout. That being said, the last trophy I had left was x number of teleports."
kongburrito,"I think I heard in PM it is 41, 42, and 43. Someone please correct me if I am wrong."
kongburrito,"I dont think the full price games thing is true, I think it is retail games in general. There are lots of psn games that released at sub 20 dollars with platinum trophies."
kongburrito,"Yeah, I set up my left air brake to L and my right air brake to R. I found that this made all the races WAY easier. "
kongburrito,"What control scheme did you use? After I switch my air brakes to L and R, I found the plat to be way more doable
"
kongburrito,"Do you know if the book can be bought individually anywhere?
"
kongburrito,I think that your upvotes towards prompts that don't follow these ideas speak louder than trying to vacation from them. Submitting good prompts that people want to write about is better than anything imo.
kongburrito,It really is. I keep a second vita next to the toilet to play when I go to the bathroom. 
kongburrito,I recently bought an old vita off of craigslist for a good price. If you pm me your details I can pass it on to you. Bond over gaming.

kongburrito,"Yeah, I dont know how many hours this one was, but it really wasn't the worst grind ever. About 120 characters to get to S rank, 2 at a time, about 20 minutes per pair. Then beating every level on Chaos, which was difficult, but there were some abusable tricks with certain characters."
kongburrito,"That mission in the first Call of Duty, Pavlov's house, is fucking ridiculous on Veteran. I had to do it so many times, only way I could recognize that shot."

kongburrito,Jurrassic the hunted. Its perfectly bad as you would expect
kongburrito,I'm in again!
kongburrito,"I think the best example of DLC rarity percentages being reflected poorly are the Batman Arkham City DLC's. For people thinking we should use just PSNP's, check those. I promise you more than 5000 people have the DLC, but it only counts those that have earned a single trophy in it
"
kongburrito,"I'd like to thank Bangcrashboom.

We got the 25 versus wins in LBPV, he got his 25 first, stayed around and got my 25. We are starting the 2x bubbles now"
kongburrito,"Add me, I have this game in my boxes somewhere. when I find it i would happily grind these out."
kongburrito,you can do 4 in the other game types
kongburrito,"Wow. This is really good!

I love how so many people took this prompt into the first person and personified their objects."
kongburrito,"Absolutely did. I thought it was a ""it was all a dream"" cop out ending, then it was a hospital. Then it really was an ""all a dream"" ending and I wanted to cry :(

You completed you're goal!"
kongburrito,"I like it. I think most of the responses go happy-sad, so it is nice that it reverses the roles a little."
kongburrito,You are truely a genius.
kongburrito,"I love this. 

I seriously had to step away for a second at ""Idiot. How can someone not know what a rat-year is?""
"
kongburrito,"I feel like I got played twice there....

I love how the last line stands true for the ending of the story too. We've all heard that ending a thousand times, but we never see it coming :("
kongburrito,"As a trophy hunter, I hit Velocity Ultra a couple months back and loved it. I am excited to play Velocity 2X. Sportsfriends looks fun, and I'm looking forward to playing it next week with my girlfriend, who isn't into games. I already played PS All Stars, but I may hit up online now that everyone is rushing it. Neve rplayed the first Joe Danger, but I completed the second one, so I think that will be a fun play. TxK and Hoard, I havent heard much about.

Overall; Fatisified. 7/10 stars"
kongburrito,I like this one a lot! The ending was expected but I think it was still good.
kongburrito,"I'd say Dante's inferno. 

Generally, what I do is look at the game I own with the most common trophy I havent earned, then go through them that way."
kongburrito,"As he said, the hardest is the 3rd boss on HTA. This is the general agreement among the SotC community. I think the normal ones are all reasonable, the rest is just understanding where to stand on them"
kongburrito,"Bow to the RNG gods. 

But seriously, think about how to beat each level. It's difficult, but with a plan and persistance, it is all very possible!"
kongburrito,Would love to see you continue this. This was awesome to read :)
kongburrito,"I'm glad that you've started writing! I've only written prompts, but I think you've got a good start to the story."
kongburrito,"No. I just keep an eye on my local craigslist for vitas under 100$. I buy them, and resell them since they turn around really quickly in my experience. The 60$ one came after a couple months of watching. I kept an eye on the post and it went from 120 to 60$ from monday to friday. It was in working condition, and is currently my secondary vita."
kongburrito,My best craigslist deal was a 50$ vita.
kongburrito,I really liked this one. Awesome ending!
kongburrito,"Using game saves like this is cheating in my eyes. If you haven't personally completed the task, you don't deserve the trophy."
kongburrito,This one. I liked this one!
kongburrito,"Not exactly what the prompt asked for, but I think it made a cool adaptation!"
kongburrito,It's the woord buttocks. That word should be nine characters
kongburrito,"Last black friday, GS had 8g memory cards for 10$. So if you need a card keep a look out for that"
kongburrito,"I think the GoW collection, the Sly collection, and Starhawk ultimate edition are pretty decent deals."
kongburrito,"I would buy a PS+ sub, they always have a AAA title for PS3 per month, so it would be a nice way to jump into the last generation"
kongburrito,"I think one stickied prediction thread a week before the end of the month is fine. It's nice to make and hear predictions, as a guessing game, but no point in treating ideas as facts for an entire month of ""TEH SWAPER IS NXT"" and such."
kongburrito,"I really liked the first one. It reminded me a lot of Crash Bandicoot: Warped. Similar linear levels, but still fun. Sly 2 was more open world, but it was pretty fun as well. I personally haven't gotten around to Sly 3."
kongburrito,"This is the cool part about the subreddit. You gave him a prompt to inspire his writing, not to write his story. I think the direction he took it was really cool too :)"
kongburrito,"I'm against it, but if they are offering it, I might as well get them... I still agree it's goofy to get ther regions of the game. As for double dipping plats by region, I think that is better. I really would like to play Arkham Asylum a second time, and running through the Japanese version would reward me for that."
kongburrito,Good thing I only 89%'d three times...
kongburrito,I love this one because changing a single word would change it greatly.
kongburrito,"I call him every night. He's gone, but remnants of his voice are left behind. I dial the number, and get three beeps."
kongburrito,I'll update it tonight when I get 76 :)
kongburrito,"I really like this one, it gave me goosebumps!"
kongburrito,"Mastery with every fighter is very difficult

The trophy requires the same 5 challenges for every character.
100 victories,
100 fatalities
150 x-rays
10000 pints of blood spilled
24:00:00 of playtime with each character.


The x-rays and the playtime can be boosted very easily online, or with two vitas. I purchased a second one of off craigslist for cheap so I can use it like this. The playtime can be halved by doing 2v2’s. The fatalities are probably what will take the longest, as it is about 13 ladders (8 fatalities per ladder) per character. These ladders (1 round, 30 sec) take about 6-8 minutes, depending on skill with that character, as well as how long the fatality animation is. That means about two hours of solid playtime with each character to get those, which is where the largest grind is. I have about half of the character completed, and it is taking a lot of push to actually complete it.
"
kongburrito,"I have 75, a lot of guys have a large number, a lot of guys have a few with some extremely impressive ones. A lot of the guys in the sub with 100+ have a really good mix of hard and easy plats from all genres."
kongburrito,"All my plats were really fun, and I honestly can't single out a prefered favorite. I think that is an important thing with being a trophy hunter. Platinums are great, but if you aren't enjoying yourself on the way there, it doesn't really matter. For instance, I'm playing Jurassic the Hunted, a pretty poorly made game. Whenever I play, I skype my friend with the game and we laugh at it together. The game is bad, but the experience is amazing.

My proudest platinum is The Shoot. I was one of the first 50 earners, and the rarity is 0.61%, even though I thought it was pretty managable. :)

I never really give up, I could go back to a game years later and finish it (5 years to finish Prototype.) Right now the game looming on me is Vanquish.

Ben Ten Galactic Racing was really easy both times I played it, but I would also say Spare Parts was fun, and Sound Shapes.

Ben Ten Galactic racing, but that was just a downtime plat while I got back in the groove of my current game.

Galaga Legions DX. I don't 100% enough games......

You're template asks some questions, but misses some of the things that a seasoned hunter could tell you. Play games you enjoy, this is a hobby not a chore. Personally, I have very few platinums with online trophies, because I don't really enjoy the grind that comes with them. I suggest having two or three games at a time, while some people recommend only one. If you are going for a long platinum, breaking it up with easier 100%'s or plats can make it a lot more manageable. Don't be afraid to try and fail at hard plats, the only way to get there is to practice. Don't be embarassed by your easy plats. If you're enjoying the game, there isn't an issue."
kongburrito,"Proteus is artsy, in a different way than Fez or Journey. It didn't take what we see as traditional 3D graphics, and instead used a simpler graphical look that gave it great aesthetics. I find it to be interactive art, almost in the same way Linger in Shadows was. Your actions matter less in the whole of the game rather than what you feel are accomplished from your actions. The art is more than what you see visually, but can also be what emotions the game makes you feel while playing it. 

I'm not saying that PES is a better or worse game than this, because I haven't played PES. But I don't bash the sports game genre when one comes up, just because I don't enjoy them. I simply didn't download it, and I think my subscription is still worth the money for the games I do enjoy, even if some of them are misses."
kongburrito,"Are the servers not shut down in this game? If not, I might grab the platinum."
kongburrito,"High Plat percentage, in my mind, is probably because of the style of game. A lot of people who like JRPG's generally want to complete them, and it sounds like the plat didnt take to long (relatively)  and wasn't much of an extension to the gameplay completion. At the same time, it is also a part 2, so it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of people started with the first one, and decided the second one wasn't for them, leaving only the ""more dedicated"" players."
kongburrito,"It is an artsy game. 

I know it's a hard pill for you to swallow, but I personally really enjoyed the game. There is no set goal, the aesthetics are good, and it has a good experience. When I sat down expecting a bad game, I was genuinely surprised. I enjoyed playing a game because I wanted to see what there was to discover. It was relaxing in a sense, and I didn't feel pressured to do anything beyond explore.

Not every title it's going to got the bill for every player. There are people that enjoyed the game, and I'm glad to see Healthy mix of genres rather than all shooters or platforming games. I don't like sports games, but I didn't get my panties in a bunch when PES was free. 

The game doesn't have to look good, because graphics don't define the game. Borderlands two didn't have a realistic art style, but people don't spit on that game locking bad. If you want to give Sonya message, be the first to cancel your subscription."
kongburrito,"I get off work at 5pm eastern, so if you add me I can help you out too."
kongburrito,"Add me, I've been playing this game with some friends recently. If you have skype, PM me that and I'll get you in our group chat. While I'm only working with them for the tower of babble trophy, you and I can work on the doors and equipable items trophy. We generally play between 5-10 pm eastern time on weekdays, and almost any time all of us are free on the weekends."
kongburrito,"Thats a pretty weird trend. I think I may be someone who did that also though. I thought it wasn't a turn based RPG so I decided to try it, then was kind of turned off to it.
"
kongburrito,"I'm glad she refused to speak to you during the movie.
You shouldn't talk during a movie."
kongburrito,"Nope, sorry"
kongburrito,"I edited my comment. These machines were new, and were not up to our company standard at the time of this fuck up. The machine is now fixed so it can be adjusted without bypassing the guarding."
kongburrito,"This is the case for our plant. The welder that I was adjusting had it's settings right beyond the safety door, by opening it, I was in no way in immediate danger. The door now has a small opening in the plexiglass so the buttons on the welder can be pressed (you dont have to reach through the guarding, as the buttons are right on the other side)"
kongburrito,No one got canned for this mistake.
kongburrito,No sir.
kongburrito,"He wasn't screwed, I actually didn't hear much of it after that day."
kongburrito,"Sacrifice one virgin before all plats. I find this to be a key move in trophy hunting.

Or instead you could look at road map and see what you are getting into. Decide if you want the plat to come naturally, or quick as possible. For example, would you rather play Heavy Rain with a guide the first time (that would blow) or without one....

"
kongburrito,"Alright, add me and message me this week. I'm free from 5:30pm to 9:30pm on weeknights. (Eastern US)"
kongburrito,"I own this game, but I havent really played it. How literate in dungeon seige must I be to help you out?"
kongburrito,Chudat has a killer kirby though. Tiers aren't restrictions.
kongburrito,"That will be on the off days
"
kongburrito,"I just started working on Warriors Orochi 3, while also shooting for a trophy a day."
kongburrito,This issue happened a while back and was caused by some signatures having links to malicious websites.
kongburrito,"I remember when I got this platty, I thought that all my enemies were pro baseball players. :("
kongburrito,"A batter works fine. I used a dead (wouldnt power my calculator) triple A, and that worked just fine. Then the game broke :("
kongburrito,I'm in
kongburrito,"I'll drop my tips this weekend, I haven't forgotten about you :)"
kongburrito,"Please count me in again, dgaustin"
kongburrito,"If you tell me which levels, I can give you what strategies worked for me."
kongburrito,"Give it a go. You'll get strategies for each level. Sometimes, you'll want to go fast, but slow and steady is what wins the race in certain levels."
kongburrito,"The game is Dyad, and it is 0.7% rarity here, and 1.64 on psnp"
kongburrito,"I think the early levels and later levels feel the same as the major issue. I like the luck of the draw system that is currently had, because I get to be on my toes for my favorite levels. Perhaps unlocking levels gives bonuses, like double bumper value on all previous levels or something of the sort. I really think it is necessary that extra coins are added on the later levels though.

If you want me to play test a new system, I'd be more than happy to volunteer as tribute."
kongburrito,"Really enjoyed the game, I think the pacing is pretty good. I really don't like how the later levels and the early levels feel the exact same though. Maybe add more coins to the later levels so they are worth the 8000 points I spent on them? Otherwise, I would have just stopped purchasing levels at level 9, which I think has the highest possible return per play."
kongburrito,"http://imgur.com/sppf6zG

Surprised at how long The Shoot has been up there. It was at 0.27% when I earned it."
kongburrito,"I imagine being on the bottom helps preserve the fruit better, "
kongburrito,"Sly give conn the ban, plox"
kongburrito,"It breaks the flow of the game to always teleport if I slip into the water, as opposed to climbing out of the water on the pier or something."
kongburrito,"I think it was pretty easy. I managed to get through all them after two or three tries, with exception to 50. I also completed speedrun and score runs for all of them."
kongburrito,"Which challenge in particular?

I found them all fairly easy, but I also think I am pretty good at that game. 

Make sure you are hitting critical strikes, spamming square isnt going to cut it. You need to tap it as you flow through combat. These give you 2x multiplier for each hit, and are worth more points. Use your special abilities. if you have a long combo through a round triple tap O on the last guy then get the groundpound finish for massive points. The ground pound finish should not be under estimated, and it can be used up to the very last second before someone is about to stand up..
 
If you have any more specific questions, I'll answer the best I can."
kongburrito,"Spare Parts is a really easy plat.
If you have a vita, I thought Velocity Ultra was pretty easy too."
kongburrito,This subreddit pertains to exactly this topic. Good job :)
kongburrito,And I think beating the game on new game plus.
kongburrito,"Beat the game eating less than 10 civilians.
Beat the game on hard.
Beat the game without dying.
Find all the collectables.
Kille 46k (or 56k) infected...."
kongburrito,"The game is really good in my opinion. Took me about a weekend of gameplay, probably 15-20 hours. Way easier than Prototype..."
kongburrito,The official Sony app is pretty decent
kongburrito,"Some people have used sky hook to compete challenges in multiple cities in one day. Couldn't get mine to work

Edit. Get I boosted mk9 with you a little. Think you got that plat on vita. I am still working on mine :)"
kongburrito,"Resogun would be on my list of easy ps4 plats. Honestly, I think it can be done in a day or two with as little effort. 1cc is difficult but can be done with a friend"
kongburrito,"Sound shapes is really easy.....
Honestly, there are some annoying death modes, but overall it could be WAY WAY WORSE"
kongburrito,"Can confirm, am laughter"
kongburrito,"Hah. Honestly I really enjoyed it..... is a rare 100% and it be more rate on vita (like most games)  while the levels were hard, the game was loud and exciting when you win. The conquering of a level you just died in 5zillion times in was reward in itself. 

I just mentioned I liked the game and was looking forward to a sequel and they told me to get the vita version and fans that quite then make it awesome. I'll dig up the email tonight if I can"
kongburrito,"I really love that the developers didnt see the extortion in that.
"
kongburrito,"I remember that level......
I think my friend was cracking up when he came over and I was on death 1200 something...  although I sent the devs a nice email about my victory and they responded :). Looking forward to doing it again on the vita"
kongburrito,"Oh man. 
I honestly thought arkham asylum difficulty was over hyped..... I started the game on hard, and when I played through the challenges, I was actually confused by what the counter symbols meant. I thought it was pretty easy.... "
kongburrito,"You are the reason he doesnt want to be in the PC gaming community 
He doesnt want to circle jerk, so you say he shouldnt be part of the community. His point was proven easily"
kongburrito,"Bioshock.
everytime I start it, I feel like I missed two or three pages of a story"
kongburrito,"Yeah, you should be downvoted for that. Because that one makes sense /r/gaming."
kongburrito,"Haha, no. Funny your in a similar situation. My buddy is coming down for RTX"
kongburrito," I'm a long time trophy Hunter (69 platinum)  and I really have to agree  that guides  dull down my enjoyment of a game. A guide walking you through every step of the game to get you every trophy on one play is the most boring thing in the world,  and I have 0  platinum that require this.  What I do,  and some of my trophy hunting friends  di as well,  is look at a "" roadmap""  to acquire an  idea of what the platinum emails ( collectables,  number of playthroughs,  missable  trophies)  and play from there. I may use a guide when I get to the area  with a missable  trophy,  but if rather do two playwrights and enjoy a game  before doing an extremely  dull playthrough  with a guide.

I have used collectable guides,  but most games I have can be collected after the fact. I  prefer  to  use collectable guides,  as I find them  more fun then running around the game jamming r3  until  my finger is broken (infamous)"
kongburrito, Should have told him this is why people don't shop at best buy
kongburrito," two peas in a pod here..
I keep looking for people on Craiglist  with an unused  online code. its  generally cheaper to trade than to buy the codes  from the store.  good luck :)"
kongburrito," add  me, dgaustin. I  can help on ps4.  please  have a microphone :)
I will be available after work (5pm  eastern)  all of next week  to help you"
kongburrito,"Thats a picture right off of Lamar Blvd in ATX. I remember hearing about this from a friend of a friend of a friend. Very legit, am friend "
kongburrito,"Sheesh, I must have not remembered that game well.... Sorry for misleading everyone :(
"
kongburrito,"Depends on the game.

For games I really want to enjoy, normal. For long games, generally I start on hardest if difficulties stack.
If it is a game that is notorious for being easy, I'll start on hard."
kongburrito,"Gravity Rush

Do you think that a clean up (going back to levels) counts as an extra playthrough? If not, there are a lot of great games."
kongburrito,"Your list is missing weapons then. Ninja star, brick, those sort of things."
kongburrito," this trophy has a misleading clue.
 you don't need a kill with each weapon,  but rather a  brutal takedown.  you must finish an enemy with the weapon when they are knocked  om the ground rather than just hit them with the weapon.  Hope this information helps!
I think that is the exact same list I used,  so you are on the right track. :)"
kongburrito, yeah. I  guess I've never been to into the turn based rpgs. I enjoy getting new loot but I hate trying to manage  all the loot
kongburrito,"Grats. RPG's are always dedicating plats, so its impressive as it stands with a few :)"
kongburrito," Id you always  ask for the benefit of the doubt,  people will begin to doubt your benefit"
kongburrito, this is an app  called PlayStation trophies on android i think
kongburrito,grats!  what Is your psn?
kongburrito," 90-100 hours, with 3 or 4 glitched trophies, IIRC"
kongburrito,"Yeah. I dont think it is possible to get the plat before the server shutdown, but I cant say I've done my research"
kongburrito,"FreeRealms... 
 considering It is Sonys  game, a  last wouldn't surprise me at this point"
kongburrito,"Yeah, considering how many games you have at 0%, I feel like your percentage is understandable."
kongburrito,"I always liked to act like I was speedrunning.
Even if I'm not, I like to try and make that really hard jump 100 times, because that 1 time I get it is very satisfying. I go for all the little tricks and timesavers, even though I havent mastered them, nor do I ever plan to."
kongburrito,Grats on the plat :D
kongburrito,"If you have one trophy in a game, it will push your completion percentage down a lot, but having 0 trophies will leave it unaffected. 
What is your psn handle? I'll look into it"
kongburrito,"I'm going to be the guy that says ""probably shouldnt play games at work"""
kongburrito,"The score is based on your trophy score/total score (not including games you have not earned a trophy in)

So say you have 5000 points, out of a possible 20000. 3000 of your potential points are in a game you havent gotten above 0% in. Your completion percentage would be 5000/17000"
kongburrito,"Jamestown
"
kongburrito,I've already hit 40. Having trouble with some of the other trophies actually :(
kongburrito,  I  would like  to blame  my success on  all of you
kongburrito,"Two weeks, very close to all at once. 
Either way, welcome to the ps family!
If you ever need help with Resogun, I got pretty good and could probably help with 1CC :)"
kongburrito,"I decided I wanted to race it up so I bought two corvettes  and a  Porsche  on the fly...  just a casual everyday purchase,  you know."
kongburrito,"I suggest sticking to one game for a little bit, and getting the hang of trophy hunting before you start worrying about individual online trophies. Just my two cents :)
"
kongburrito,Do you even fucking know what aesthetics are?
kongburrito,"Oh jeez. Atleast the plat isn't too bad I heard.
I'll finish up Mw3 and Lego Harry Potter, then I'll hit that area of the backlog
"
kongburrito,How is Metro? Typical FPS?
kongburrito,"Meh, I'd pay for one on my shelf....

buying 50 for 100 a piece then selling them back off sounds not bad :)"
kongburrito,"I had teachers who had me pirate movies for them, that were more than open about it. I unfortunately dont doubt this one.
"
kongburrito,Spare yourself from Lego Harry Potter. That's all I got to say :(
kongburrito,"I always wish I could sell Plats off. I like earning mine, but I guess other gamers can earn theirs how they want (and if it includes paying me, all the better ;P)

I'd keep the money. If you really feel bad, you can send it to one of us or put it as a prize on a monthly tourney."
kongburrito,"The only site I dont think is okay is truetrophies. You have to register for that site and inflates rarities (making everything far less rare)

I'm not completely against the way it is now, it just feels unfair that DLC trophies could be worth more as far as rarity. It's a difficult conundrum, but I think you are handling it well :)"
kongburrito,"Mushroom Wars is an older game. I would look at Saints Row the Third on my profile. Older games did not have split DLC/Main Game lists, this is why they appear wrong.

I just looked at mushroom wars, the DLC is split. The trophies are rare among the DLC owners, so it should be valued high as normal.

Edit: Look at mushroom wars, no idea what is happening actually :P"
kongburrito,I have a buddy to help with some of the trophies. We should be able to get the Anarchy Master and rank 65 quickly :)
kongburrito,"I really think your rarity should be based on the psnprofiles rarity. There they only include people that have bought the DLC (earning 1 trophy) its accurate for a lot of games, only innaccurate for a few.."
kongburrito,"If you need some help on times, add me. I cleared the 40minute requirement with time to lose on some of the races. Having a ghost/base time to work off of made some of those levels a lot better :)"
kongburrito,I actually hate the vita controls. Really poor compared to the PS3...
kongburrito,"I dont get back to uni until the end of march, so we could make this work :)
I just picked the game up from Gamestop for 4$ too. I want to get that plat under my belt :)"
kongburrito,"Also, I was checking your trophy list. 
Any interest in working on the bulletstorm plat with me?"
kongburrito,"Yeah, I got the 100% in probably 8 hours of game time. I  used the dynamic camera, except on races with those crappy turns, where I swapped to aerial. Other than that it was fun, but definitely not hard :D"
kongburrito,"Yeah. To balance not getting sound shapes, I got motorstorm RC. But I would argue that it is a much harder platinum.... Oh well, I enjoyed it! I'll probably sit back in march.
Also, I earned some platinums last night that aren't updated in the spreadsheet.... :O"
kongburrito,"I've been knocking down some easy plats in the past month, so this month ill hunt down the Gravity Rush plat and all the DLC for it, Saints Row The Third, and Motorstorm RC"
kongburrito,"I enjoyed the contest. Happy with the position I pulled. Managed to tie up the plat leaderboard tonight, as well as win the gold one :)
Would have had the tourney had it not been that damn sound shapes :("
kongburrito,"Actually, it seems there are 4 regions for the Ps4 version, according to PSN Profiles
"
kongburrito,"I can always help with updating if you need. I really enjoy these tournaments when I'm not at school, helps me grind out some shorter plats."
kongburrito,"I'm in........
dgaustin

These tournaments will always lean to people who can get all the sound shape trophies. It's kind of a downer
"
kongburrito,"You, I like you."
kongburrito,"So, you dont think that maybe, they aren't marketing an M game to kids, but are providing a ""call of duty"" experience to kids that are FAR to young for the game. Just maybe? 
Fucking reddit is so quick to jump on a CoD hate band wagon. "
kongburrito,"I've got both the plats. The first requires a lot of playthroughs....
Less than 10 civs consumed, hard mode, no deaths..... And hard mode isn't laughable like the second D:"
kongburrito,The first game is much harder!
kongburrito,"I'll probably be waiting til the end of the feb trophy comp to jump back off of the games I have planned out
"
kongburrito,I'll be hitting it up as soon as I finish Gravity rush.
kongburrito,"I dont know about this game, but is the challenge a daily/weekly thing? I feel like you may need to wait for the end of the daily challenge for a trophy. Just an uneducated guess."
kongburrito,"added to my queue,  will pay"
kongburrito,"id be more than happy to do a little with you.
 can you help me with some of the 2p  challenges?"
kongburrito,"Funny, I was impressed with my 4.5 year timed plat recently. I hope you enjoyed getting yours also!"
kongburrito,What system are you on?
kongburrito," yeah, I  have a couple that I  got prior  to  the games being free on plus...
 I've stopped buying AAA  titles because they always go free on plus later. I  doubt games like ben ten are going free on it any time soon"
kongburrito,"I spent so long on challenge  six..... I  really need to go back and show that game who is the boss.  also if you haven't seen the video of the chick doing it in two minutes  or so,  go watch it.  it makes me feel bad"
kongburrito," if you need help updating the spreadsheet,  please  message me. I would be more than happy to provide the time needed.  thanks for taking over"
kongburrito,"meh, I  really ought  to finish vanquish,  damn  challenge  six"
kongburrito,"I enjoyed all of them, except all 4 one."
kongburrito,"I always tend to play my games with 10 people holding my controller. Playing with 1 sounds impossible.
"
kongburrito,How hard is this 100%?
kongburrito,"Answer the croud, what is the PS3 theme?"
kongburrito,"Oh man, I was searching my downloads, it must have been something gameshared from a friend who has sold his PS3 since. Very sorry for getting hopes up. I'd try making a gaming session on PSNProfiles..."
kongburrito,I own the game. Ill redownload today and let you get the trophy :)
kongburrito,"Like drum rocker said, the 100% completion is hard. You have to find specific items only in certain levels, but there are guides somewhere that can assist. I really enjoyed the game, I still go back to it and play it :)"
kongburrito,"Each has its own trophy list :)

Edit: This is what PSN Profiles shows. The only thing that confuses me is the Vita version saying ""Vita/PS3"" Your call ;)

One of my favorite games on the playstation, very glad it was my first platty to show off :)"
kongburrito,"You only need one other person, it is easier to do with one honestly.
"
kongburrito,Pun intended?
kongburrito,"Thats actually a really cool idea. The games I plat get put to the far right of my shelf in alphabetical order. Its goofy, but it is super satisfying to put the games there."
kongburrito,Grats on 31 plats! This was my 61st plat today as well :)
kongburrito,"I just started it back up again, and got this platinum today as #61!
I feel like I really have to space out these games, or Ill get bored mid way through."
kongburrito,"What if I wanted a real trophy for every virtual trophy I earn?
"
kongburrito,I would say this platty is very doable in under a week.
kongburrito,"I started with Katamari Forever.
One of my favorite games on the PS3, glad it took my plat virginity."
kongburrito,"Congrats! A very rare plat, looks nice in any collection :)"
kongburrito,"Oh man, I still need to give TWD another playthrough on the vita. I did all the options I wanted the first time, I think I'm going to go through and be a jerk this time around :)

If you have PS+, pick up smart as this month! It seems like it is going to be an easy platinum! I dont know if sega all star racing is still up for free, but I really enjoyed that vita platinum too!
"
kongburrito,"Coming back to it with 4 trophies left til the plat took a lot of effort. 
I had to do an additional 2 playthroughs on top of the 3/4 I did a long time ago because of my lost save file. Its a proud plat to be on my list, so I'm glad I got it :)
"
kongburrito,"I've been working on it a while. Ive been hunting a little bit since the trophy patch came out!

As long as you enjoy the games you play, plats will come eventually."
kongburrito,Oh my god I've written to my local gov a couple times back in middle/high school because I found this obnoxious. 
kongburrito,"Controls, mostly. I absolutely prefered it on the Playstation, found it much easier.

kongburrito,dgaustin
kongburrito,"I can always assist, I think a weekend is the best bet on choosing a date. I know I'll be at work a lot during the week.
Im in GMT -5"
kongburrito,"Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that!

That be a great way to be basic deterring from cheating on a typing test."
kongburrito,"Posting this was an open invitation to the idea being made! I'd love for more than one person to have their take on the idea!

And lazy fingers after typing all day :("
kongburrito,"If you end up creating it, I'd love to be kept in the loop on it's development, I have a whole lot of ideas with a whole little of ability. "
kongburrito,"If you end up creating it, I'd love to be kept in the loop on it's development, I have a whole lot of ideas with a whole little of ability. 
"
kongburrito,"I was think this as well. Perhaps a slight multiplier for WPM on the typing test? My only concern with giving them a typing test is copy and paste into an auto typer, so that would have to be disabled at a basic level."
kongburrito,"There is a game somewhat like this already called Swords and Potions. It is Free to play but absolutely pay to win after a certain point.  It''s not super incremental, but it is extremely similar to your idea."
kongburrito,"Sound shapes, Plants Vs Zombies, Wipeout 2048, Guacamelee.

Edit: Apparently  a lot of people think Wipeout is really difficult. 2048 is far far easier than HD, and the ""hardest part"" is the time consuming online nodes. This was my opinion, I didn't realize it was regarded as a difficult plat
"
kongburrito,"I have all the MW2 trophies, but I'd be more than happy to work with you through a couple missions when I get back to my PS3 in earlier january. My PSN is dgaustin, please put something in the friend request so I will recognize you."
kongburrito,"I wont be able to boost until early january, but I'd be more than happy to help you with your trophies! I already have the platinum, so you don't need to worry about an additional 99 races :)"
kongburrito,"I suggest boosting your processing skills, in my opinion so leather and metal are good. I also got piety for using undead to build wonders. I would do food soon, but wood and stone later, since they become far more abundant late game."
kongburrito,"I tend to pump a wonder out over night generally, using undead. Once I get the more expensive ones. If you dont have all the deities, your first three resets should be getting all of them, as naath said."
kongburrito,"I really suggest using the CivHelper script to add more conquests. It greatly extends the endgame. I feel like CivClicker is really about resetting more often than other clickers, for other Dieties and wonders"
kongburrito,"CivClicker by far. Lots of content, and active and vocal dev :)"
kongburrito,"At that point, I would rather just have a deity that grants more people per purchase. It likely be easier to program, and in my opinion more diverse. I just wish you could do something with idle soldiers. :("
kongburrito,"The custom increment button manages the first part.
Working two jobs would probably be tricky, and if they work half as fast, might as well just focus two workers on each skill then two workers on both."
kongburrito,"Sorry, I spoke in an awkward manner.

The amount of siege engines in some of those raids through CivHelper is too large, given the current formula doesn't work well with disgustingly large defensive fortifications, the raids take too long to be worth the effort/time investment, even using say, the undead"

kongburrito,"I dont like the civ helper anymore.
The rate of which I diminish the enemies armies, taking into account I have 100x both their fortifications and soldiers is stupidly low."
kongburrito,"With a population of 5,289,969,847,674, and an  army that can be nearly that value at any time, there needs to be a good amount of difficulty in place for late game players"
kongburrito,I really suggest that there are more raids. The game has a very low soft cap once you really get into it.
kongburrito,"Great answer! Thanks for the help!

Edit: Are there any plans to make additional conquests by you or the dev in the future?"
kongburrito,Why defend our country? As long as they don't threaten our cheese and wine I'm fine.
kongburrito,"As a long term user of Kong, you'd get a lot of ad revenue from them. We'd love to see it there. :D"
kongburrito,Thanks man. Really loved this game back in the day :)
kongburrito,"thanks for the helpful answer, I'm sure a lot of people were looking for it."
kongburrito,"Go play my friends Megaman Levels.
While I am not much of a creator myself, he worked very hard to make a working LBP Megaman.
His PSN is Dilsco, so check it out!"
kongburrito,"I really enjoy free online with the Playstation. I find the community (from what I've played) to be a little kinder/more mature. Not to say both systems don't have their fair share.
I also have playstation plus, and find the value to be incredible. When I signed up for 50$, I got about 100$ worth of games, most of which were fun and I wanted to play.

Don't let either side sway you over with their ""exclusive"" titles. Both systems have their fair share. Personally I really enjoy the God of War series, but XBox probably has some hidden gems that I would love if I played them.

In the end, I am a Sony fan and will say ""Go PS3,"" but it has to be taken into account that I grew up with Sony more than Microsoft.
 "
kongburrito,"I don't quite enjoy the speed of the game...
While I find the concept to be a lot of fun, it seems VERY hard to grab coins that aren't right next to you, and nearly impossible to get to the other side of the column. 
I enjoy the concept, and I hope you don't get downrated by spam raters who think it is just cookie cutter gameplay!
Keep it up!

Edit! Add Kongregate API ;)
Competitive high scores, are awesome."
kongburrito,"Do you allow test make ups. 
Secret achievements if someone raises a previous test grade?
Flawless Victory; Achieve all 100's for a certain grading period, be it a month or a whole semester.

How about offering a box for students to make their own quiz and test questions, and putting one on each test. Lots of achievements to be earned there."
kongburrito,"I do not have a steam.  I would like to give Lexyk the game, if he would indeed like it.

Really I just joined for fun :)

edit; I also like how my entry then got downvoted to 0..... 
Stay classy reddit "
kongburrito,"I personally don't like Kingdom Rush.
Not to be hipster, but its just a average game that is over hyped.
Personally, I really enjoyed the Fancy Pants Series. It's a great Platformer if you enjoy that sort of thing. I also really enjoyed another flash game called MoneySieze. It's a fairly difficult platformer, where you attempt to collect 1001 coins over 40-50 levels. The levels get harder and harder with additional challenges like no double jumps, pacifism, and speed runs. It's a lot of fun, but very difficult to complete. Some single coins can take me 100's of deaths to get, but it is very satisfying to finish it.

For Rhythm/Music games, try out DJManiax. It's difficult at first but it's a lot of fun to claim mastery of a song.
Any elephant games are fun. JBMT or however he organizes those letters always pumped out some fun ones. This is the Only Level and Achievement Unlocked 2 are probably my favorites.

If you like RPG's, play through the MARDEK series. The first one is about 20 minutes, the second one is a couple hours, and the third one is probably upwards of 20-30 to complete everything. 
Hero's Arms, while an old game, is another RPG game that is super fun. It feels a lot more like Legend of Zelda, while Mardek revolves around a turn based combat system.
If you're just in it for the battles, go for Epic Battle Fantasy 2/3. Both are also a lot of fun.

If you like a genre of game that I didn't already mention here, help me help you. I like to think I'm fairly knowledgeable about these kinds of things.

edit; Noticed you said you only have half an hour. Play [Heir](http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/heir?acomplete=heir) It's a lot of fun, a platformer, and you will feel like you are playing Shadow of the Colossus. "
kongburrito,"Not a really fair contest, as I am clearly at the advantage due to my incredible background in the arts.

kongburrito,What is your favorite Cheesey Bread?
kongburrito,"It's awesome to know you and your brother had such a tight bond, even if it was over a game.
Sorry for your loss."
kongburrito,I joined a Young Life group (a church group) just to be closer to a hot girl. I had a girlfriend at a time and ended up embarrassing myself.
kongburrito,That video just about covers every feature the game has to offer.
kongburrito,For the low low price of 19.96
