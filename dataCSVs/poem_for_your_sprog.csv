""It wasn't a *rape.*  
I just meant to see that she couldn't escape.  
I'm merely a victim of troublesome luck.""  
The judge leaned towards him. 

He whispered: ""... the fuck?""

Poem_for_your_sprog,"He stared at the question, and that's when he knew -  
He'd spied it before in a thread or a few.  
He'd read what they'd written.  
He'd studied and seen.  
He'd viewed every comment and all in-between!

He knew every sentence.  
He knew every post.  
Each feature, each fiction, each humblebrag boast!  
He'd read every story.  
He'd read every pun.  
Each fib and each fable, and now he was done!  

""What is it?"" he wondered.  
""What is it?"" he said.  
""And what could have happened?"" he pondered with dread.  
He hit the 'refresh', and he trembled to check.

He looked at the questions.

He whispered: ""... oh *heck*."""

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Every thought inside him screams:  
""Go outside and live your dreams!  
Take a wish and make it true!  
Make a better world for you!""

Every word inside him cries:  
""Try the future on for size!  
Find the finer, wiser way!  
Build yourself a brighter day!""

Every voice inside him speaks:  
""Climb the highest mountain peaks!  
Take the chance to make it so!

... maybe start tomorrow though."""
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I've got it!' said Satan, and grinned with delight:  
'May all of their sneezes arrive in the night!  
May all of their tables be tippy!' he cried:  
'May of all their laces be loose and untied!

'May all of their digits be stubbed till they bleed!  
May all of their captchas be vexing to read!  
May all of their dinners be slow to defrost!  
May all of their keys be departed and lost!

'May all of their queues be unbearably long!  
Forever relentlessly stuck on a song!  
Forever upsetting and spilling their drink!  
Forever no step on the stair where they think!'  

He giggled, demented, and wiggled with joy!  
He chuckled, contented, and pleased with his ploy!  
He danced and he bopped and he bounded and bounced!  

*'And let there be stones in their shoes!'* he announced."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"""How was fishing?"" she had started,  
But she finished in despair -  
For her happy face departed  
In the horror of his stare.

He was static, still and muted,  
And she watched him simply stand -  
Still in fishing gear and booted  
With his spear inside his hand.

He was drenched and he was dripping -  
He was wet with something slick -  
And the drops that started slipping  
To the carpeting were thick.  

But he heard the word she'd spoken,  
And he turned to face her, pained -  
And he whispered, hurt and broken:  

""... twas an *orgy*,"" he explained."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Right they ramble, left they wander,  
Walk, meander, stop and ponder,  
Shuffle softly, amble aimless,  
Stroll and saunter, slow and shameless -  

On they go in shifting stages,  
Steps that seem to last for ages,  
Short and fiftful pausing paces,  
Frequent stops to tie their laces -

Clumsy, halting, motion-ceasing,  
Path-obstructing, speed-decreasing,  
Drifting,  
Roaming,  
Slowly,  
Slowing -  

*Everywhere* the fuck I'm going."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy wrote a song,  
The saddest song of all -  
His words were played and passed along,  
And people came to call.

They told him what a voice he had -  
They kept him warm a while -  
And even though his song was sad,  
Their plaudits made him smile.  

So Timmy turned his gaze above  
To sight the stars and sighed.  

But Timmy married Courtney Love.

And Timmy fucking died."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy worked his shift,  
And felt the lull begin -  
His sleepy eyes began to drift...  
Until the *creep* came in.

He watched him hard, as well he ought,  
And though it made him glum -  
'I mustn't worry,' Timmy thought,  
'A trucker's sure to come.' 

So Timmy grinned with real delight.  
He served the creep with pride.  

But no one else came in that night.  

And Timmy fucking died.  "

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy met himself,

He chomped with his chompers, he cravingly crunched -   
He nibbled, he gobbled, he guzzled, he chewed -  
He foraged and fed on a fountain of food!

A pudding. A pancake. A pizza. A pie -  
A mountain of candy that stretched to the sky!  
A cluster of chickens. A cookie. A cake -  
They crumbled inside him, they fell in his wake!

He scoffed and he snacked and he swallowed his haul -  
With nary a thought to the fallout at all!  
For when he had feasted and finished the feat -  
He found, to his horror: 

*You are what you eat.*"

Of old and new -   
Of all the things we like to do,  
And all the things we long to see,

And all is sweet, and all is swell,  
And all our future's taking shape -  

I bring the talk around to rape.  "

He rode it to and fro -   
He rode it when and how he'd like,  
And where he chose to go.

He rode it fast, and rode it far,  
And rode it mile on mile -  
And when he passed a lowly car,  
He'd pump his fist and smile.

He rode with hope and pride.  
But Tim was young,

He shuts his eyes,  
He lies beneath the weight and sighs,  
The stress, the strain,  
the doubt, the day,  
And all his worries sail away...

It holds him close,  
it holds him still,  
It keeps him safe and warm until  
He floats beyond,  
he drifts, he dreams,  
And all is sure and sweet, it seems.

And underneath,  
the seconds cease.  
He is content.  
He is at peace.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;At the time it was hard to realize I'd done the right thing, she'd sounded so betrayed on the phone when she realized I'd called the police for her, but she's since turned it around, she's okay, and that's the main thing. 

Perhaps you will think I'm betraying your trust -  
Uncaring, unrightful, unfair and unjust.   
Perhaps you will think that I should have been true -  
Been open and artless,  
been honest with you.  

Perhaps you will think that I shouldn't have lied -  
Should simply accepted your wishes, or tried.  
Perhaps you will wish that I'd dallied or stalled -  
Perhaps you will wish that you'd never have called.  
 
But maybe, and hopefully, soon you will know -  
I could not, I would not, I can't let it go. 
 
I will not regret it.  

I won't let it be.  

So never forget it.

You matter to me.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"You've never truly smelled the smell,  
the misbegotten scent of hell,  
the rancid, rotten, stinking sigh  
of salmon,  
ass,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"He looks at the bowl with a tear in his eye -  
For all that he'd worked for was just slipping by.  
'It's tragic,' he whispers, 'a sadness, a sin -  
But maybe, just *maybe*...'

He puts it back in.  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"And deep inside him, down below,  
His bowels move, his fluids flow,  
His kidneys shift an inch or two,  
With room to spare  
and lots to do.  

His liver lifts,  
his lungs expand,  
For now they've space to lend a hand,  
A place to be, a great expanse,  
They breathe again, they take the chance. 

His heart at last has room to beat,  
There's space for all the food he'll eat,   
And all is fair and fine and fit -  

Until the *next* gigantic shit.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"He sighs in the stillness.  
He sits on his seat.  
The peace is perfection,  
the silence is sweet.  
He lazes, contented  
in comfort and bliss -  
To treasure forever  
the pleasure of this.   

But something disturbs him.  
The calm is bizarre.  
It's quiet, too quiet,  
too quiet by far.  
A boom from above him  
descends into cries.  
 
The silence is broken.   

'... goddammit,' he sighs. "

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;The first thing you hear is the surface breaking and someone screaming at the edge of the pool.



And I slip and I swim through the water and smile.  
I am swift and serene,  
I am calm for a while.  
And I'd linger for life for this life that I lack...

But I lift up my head and the screaming is back.  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy had a dream,  
He slowly, softly said -  
'How truly lovely it would seem  
To spend the day in bed.  

'I'd while away the morn,' said he,  
'With nothing much to do -  
I'd doze away the day to be,  
And wake afresh, anew.  

'I'd sit on down and settle back,  
Or simply stay and smile -  
Content to shun the beaten track,  
Away from life a while.

'But first I need a good excuse -  
A reason *why*,' he sighed.

So Little Timmy tied a noose.  

And Timmy fucking died.

'I walk around in underwear

I fart aloud and laugh, aware

'I dump my clothes, or make a heap  
Of dirty jeans divine -  
And when I lay me down to sleep,  
The bed's completely mine!  

'There's really nothing quite as neat,  
Or swell as well as true -  
Or half as fine, a sixth as sweet  
As living just for you.'

And so he took the stairs the same,

He fell back down.  

And no one came.  

And Timmy fucking died. "

My mother and father and sister beside.  
I saw my old teacher.  
My Great Uncle Pat.  
My friend and the milkman.  
My brother.  
My cat.

I went to Kyoto, and there I beheld -  
The kid in my class who had gotten expelled.  
I looked at my dentist.   
My first-cousin Eve.  
My co-workers, Sophie and Simon and Steve.

I went to Kyoto, and there with defeat -  
I noticed the lady who lives down the street.  
My grandpa and grandma.  
My old buddy Jack.  

I went to Kyoto.

I'm not going back.

'And now it's only mine,' he said,

And stared below with hope and pride,  
To where it sat, a shape in shade,

I saw it then,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I would shake off wishful thinking -  
I would study hard at school -  
And I'd never care for drinking,  
Doing drugs,  
or being cool.    

I'd be careful what I borrow  
From the future form of me -  
And I'd think about tomorrow,  
And how better it would be.  

I would take for granted never  
All the friendships that I've found -  
For they do not last forever,  
But they might this time around.

I would live for every minute,  
Every moment, every day -  
Every single second in it,  
For they swiftly slip way.  

And I'd have myself a baby,  
Make a fortune, find some fame.  
Or just maybe...  

or just maybe...

I would do it all the same.  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"""You can call me for a quicky"",  
Reads the writing on the wall -  
And the handle's sorta sticky,  
And there's spiders in the stall.

There's a droplet and it's drooling,  
And I'm feeling it's amiss -  
For it might be water pooling,  
But I'm pretty sure it's piss.

There's a crack along the casing,  
And there's garbage and there's grime -  
And I'm vigilantly bracing  
For attack at any time.

There's a bunch of buttons missing,  
And there's gum inside the slot -   
And the phone has started hissing,  
And the cable's in a knot.

And it's rancid,  
and it's rotten,  
But I'm lonely, all alone.

It is gone,  
but not forgotten.
 
How I love my mobile phone."

A film to frighten, fret, amuse,  
A case to hold inside our hands,  
A sleeve we picked from shelves and stands  
To read the front.  
To choose a snack.  
To pick a film and put it back,  
And search amongst the rest and then,  
We'd simply pick the first again.

We used to stop inside the store.

But what's with the *cancer?* I mean - what the *hell*?  

'There's tons of diseases, and no extra health -  
There's too many needs, and a shortage of wealth.  
There's taxes and bills and there's problems galore -  
I worked for forever, and still I was poor!  

'There's only one mode, and it's 'Fatally Hard' -  
You leave it disordered and mentally scarred!  
The crimes and the wars and the wrongs are obscene -  
Achievements are few and infrequent between!  

'Let's face it, it's finished, and falling apart.  
You need to design it again from the start.  
Completely delete it, and call it an end.  
I give it F minus.

You might take a moment to rise to the test -  
Or celebrate living by living your best.  
You might find a person to love on your own -  
Or maybe get through it and do it alone.  

I know that it's all very easy to say -  
And maybe, just maybe, you *won't* find a way -

Holey molars, grate and hew -  
Grinding pearly whites a while -  
Hasty tasting half a smile. 

In between I push them all -  
Thick ones, thin ones, big ones, small -  
Pull them in and push them through -  
Scrape them, squeeze them, tease them too.

You should have been more.  
You sat there in silence.  
You sat there and *knew*.  

I needed somebody.  

It should have been you.

'I'm usually drunk, and I'm frequently high.  
I waste all my time till the end of the day.  
I care about nothing.  
I'm here for the pay.  

'I fake lots of sickness.  
I'm rarely on time.  
I use my computer for Netflix and Prime.  
I shirk every duty.  
I don't think ahead.  
I steal people's lunches from fridges,' she said.

You may not know -  
That China isn't glued below.  
They keep it down, but now and then  
It simply rolls back up again.  

At first they tried with pins and things -  
They tied it down with shreds of strings -  
They lashed it back with threads and rope -  
But nothing really seemed to cope.  

Until, that is, the fated day  
They formed a plan and found a way,  
For all it took's a simple wall. 

Just thirteen *thousand* miles.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Once upon a classroom dreary, while he pondered lessons weary,  
Over many a quaint and curious textbook of forgotten lore -  
There he pondered, nearly napping, whereupon there came a tapping,  
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at the desk before -  
'Tis somebody else,' he muttered, 'tapping at the desk before -  
Only this and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly came the creaking, came the whining, came the squeaking,  
Came the sight of penis peeking just beyond that desk of yore -  
How it rose and grumbled, groaning, rasped and murmured, mumbled, moaning,  
Stretched and strained and hummed like droning tones and throbs of someone's snore -  
Deep, profound and ringing, rolling tones and throbs of someone's snore -  
Like a mighty lion's roar.

'Lord above,' he whispered gently, horrified and consequently,  
So perturbed and so intently troubled to his very core -  
That he rose to see it showing, stated as it grated, growing,  
'So I really must be going, going through this classroom door' -  
And 'tis said he still is going, gone beyond that classroom door -  
For they saw him - nevermore.

And reads the post that's first to see  
And laughs and smiles a while again.

Selects an extra post to read,  
Another, other wall of text,  
And not a thing he hears indeed,  
Nor ever will, but still with joys,  
He reads the question asked below,  
Regarding deafness, farts and noise.

He shuts his eyes.

But life isn't meant to be lived on a shelf.  
Though some were a failure,

I'd only regret doing *nothing* at all.'  "

Poem_for_your_sprog,"My name is Joe,  
I have one shoe.  
I don't have four,  
I don't have two.  
I don't have more.  
I don't have less.  
I have one shoe,  
just one,  
I guess.

My name is Joe,  
I have one shoe.  
A half a pair,  
a part of few.  
A number two  
I do not own.  
I have but one,  
to wit:  
a lone.

My name is Joe,  
I have one shoe.  
I have one shoe,  
but one will do.  
I have one shoe.  
My name is Joe.  

It gets me where  
I want to go.  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt; But even if she was telling the truth, why the hell would you buy a zucchini someone else bit into?!

She stood and she stared at the end of the aisle -  
A glint in her eye, and the twitch of a smile -  
For there, on the shelf, in the midst of them all -  
It sat and it waited and held her in thrall.

'Good heavens,' she whispered.  
'Good gracious,' she said.  
She silently gazed at the glory ahead.  
The longing she fancied and feared to admit -  
The gossamer glimmer of shimmering spit. 

'I want it,' she murmured.  
'I need it,' she spoke.  
She circled the hollow.  
She gave it a stroke.  
She lifted her hands to her lips with a sigh.   

She bought the zucchini. 

I still don't know why."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When she's scootin' under cover,  
And she's stumpin' to the D -  
She's the hottest little lover  
That you'd ever hope to see.

When she's flashin' me a nipple,  
And she's feelin' handi-keen -  
She's the cutest little cripple  
That you've ever really seen.  

She's the perfect girl for kissin' -  
She's my pretty amputee -  
And she might be mostly missin',  
But she's more than that to me.   "

In a cupboard by your bed -  
In a suitcase with your scanties,

You can use it when you need it,

If it's flavoured, you can feed it  
To your darling

You can rub it on your rammer -  
You can spread it on your skin -

In the silence where we slept -  
And manoeuvred to surround us  
As we wandered and we wept.

'There was nothing but the killing -  
There was little 'cept for death -  
And the sounds of noises chilling,  
And the stench of human breath.

As the seconds passed them by -

He had thought to take his shot -  
And he hoped to find an answer,  
But they only whispered:

Made it better...

Some parents are blue.  
And some are unbearable,  
terrible too.  
Some parents are thoughtless,  
And others unfair.  
And some are inconstant,  
And some never there.  

Some parents are vicious.  
Some parents are hard.  
And some leave you lonely,  
And some leave you scarred.  
Some parents are lazy,  
And others unkind.  
And some only wreck  
And corrupt what they find.

Some parents are awful -  
But others are not.  
They give and they give  
And they give what they've got.  
They hold you together.  
They show you what's true.  

We don't get to choose them. 

I'm glad I had you."

One hazy, crazy night -  
He dreamt of seas and oceans deep  
In shining beams of light.  

He dreamt of birds and herds of beasts -  
Of clouds and moons and stars -  
Of dancing cats and fancy feasts  
On Jupiter and Mars. 

He dreamt of all that was before -  
And all that's still to be -  
And all that is, and all, and more,  
For you, and him, and me.

He dreamt of endless spreads and spans  
Of time and space beside -  
But Timmy's friends had other plans.  

And Timmy fucking died.

It rears its ugly head to scream,  
And speaks in wounds and words of fright  
In broken sleep and haunted dreams.

It tells me dark and secret things.  
It raises hands to hold me down,  
And all the cold and pain it brings  
Is thrice enough to make me drown. 

But I have read this tale before.  
And I can tell you this, my friend -  
That some day I will fear no more,  
And monsters all are made to end."

my Timmy through tests!

In silent dread and constant fear -  

There must be more.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Crawling, writhing, clawing, creeping,  
Scraping walls in whispered weeping,  
Ragged breathing,  
narrowed spaces,  
Broken edges,  
choking places.  

Caught and captured, clutching, clasping,  
Bloody hands with fingers grasping,   
Painful panting,  
aching, wheezing,  
Rising waters,  
strangle, squeezing.  

On and on and on you're crawling,  
Sinking, drowning, flailing, falling,  
Failing, gaining nothing, never.  

Every second lasts forever.

 Start a riot, press destruct.

Andy might be kinda strange.  
Bold, bizarre, and prone to change.  
Predisposed to stand and stare.  
Non-too-normal.  
Not all there.  

Andy might be kinda weird.  
Maybe friends have disappeared.  
Gone to Andy's house and then -  
Never really seen again.

Andy's odd, but when it's tough -  
When your days and nights are rough -  
When you're lost and down in doubt - 

Andy's there to help you out.

And the night is mine to keep -  
When I'm drifting and I'm dreaming  
In the seconds next to sleep -  
Then I let my thoughts a-wander  
Through the secret rooms behind -  
And the places where I ponder,  
In the spaces of my mind.  

I will dream about the ocean,  
Where the waves are waving free -  
In the endless swell of motion  
On an ever-moving sea -  
And I'll think about the glimmer  
Of the shining in the stars -  
On a ship to see the shimmer  
From the rusty dust of Mars.   

I will dream about the never -  
I will dream about the all -  
I will dream about forever,  
And through fancy I will fall.  
I will dream about the clearing,  
And I'll dream about the day -  
And when all my dreams are nearing,  
I will dream...
  
.. and drift away.

And when it was time that you settled your debt -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy saw a thread  
That made him laugh and grin -  
He loved so much the words he read,  
He said: 'I must begin!

'I'll take myself to birthing wards  
And make a hundred stops -   
To vex and bait the angry hoards  
Of newly-fashioned pops! 

'I'm such a wise and witty lad,'  
He said with pointless pride.  
And Timmy met an angry dad.

And Timmy fucking died.  "

Makes a little butter lighter,  
Bites a little bit of butter,  
Spits it back

Drools a little yellow spittle,  
Slavers, dribbles just a little,  
Takes and bakes it, making roasties...

Smears and rubs it on his toasties.

I will not stand up brave and free.

I will not rise up strong and proud.  
I will not,  
*will not*,

I'll do it like I always do.  

With scorn and spite and fuck you too.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;I need to stop reading this thread. I'm learning so much but at the cost of my peace of mind.

The house was a sparkle of spruceness and space -  
Of order and neatness and things in their place.  
The toilet was tidy.  
The microwave clean.  
The sponges as sponged as the washing machine.  

She stepped up the sterilised stairs to the hall -  
She walked past the purified prints on the wall -  
She looked in the bedroom.   

He vacuumed the bed.

Sludgy lumps of something green -  
Fallen hairs and flakes of *shit*...

And so I checked the house and soon,  
When I was sure she heard no more,  
I softly,  
softly,  
whispered:

Above, behind, below!

The way it paints our Earthly sphere  
In gassy coats of air!

The cold and milky crop -  
And spy the sunlight softly gleam  
From off its frosty top!'

We arrived here unrelated -  
We were born alone, apart -  
But perhaps we only waited  
For our *family* to start.

You were caring,  
you were giving,  
You were all I really had -  
And you made my life worth living  
When the good times turned to bad.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"And she giggled when she found it,  
And she plucked it from its stand -  
And she slipped her fingers round it,  
And she gripped it in her hand.  

She was smiling when she started,  
And she held and squeezed it slow -  
And her lips were slightly parted,  
As she clutched and looked below.  

She was squeezing,  
she was *squeezing*,  
And the sound of *squeezing* stuck -  
And I sat before her wheezing...

Till she gave me back my duck.

Think the western life is fun?  
Well you lookin' at him now, boy,

Put your puny shooter down -

Just take my Uncle Vince -  
He went to practice mimicry.  

He's not been heard from since.

We faithful few who do it still -  
Who always gave our all -  
Were doing fair and fine until  
We hit the fated wall.

So now we mime in misery -  
For none,  
to no delight -  
In places no one comes to see.
 
On bathroom floors at night.

'God bless you, and thanks... *motherfucker*,' he said.

And so, with a laugh and a smile and a sigh -  
He just *disappeared* in the blink of an eye.  
His clothes were all empty -  
they fell to the floor.  
And Sammy -  
and Sammy -  
was Sammy  
no more."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'You don't have to take me to answers,' she said -  
'You don't need to give me the books that you've read.  
You don't need to tell me the how and the why -  
You just have to show me you're willing to *try.*

'You won't always,  
don't always  
get what you need -  
And try as you might, you won't *always* succeed.  
But if you can promise to just get along -  
I know you can show me the will to be strong. 

'This world isn't easy, and sometimes it's tough -    
And sometimes you'll try and it won't be enough -  
But *if* you can do it,  
then *I* want to see.  

And girl - what a wonderful woman you'll be.'"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"There's many things that Britons do,  
And very many *well* -  
We're first in line for every queue.  
Our fish and chips excel. 

Our humour's dry.  
Our weather's wet.  
Our Yorkshire Pudding's baked.  
Our slang's absurd, and don't forget -  
The pasty pastry's flaked.

We lead the way in classic rock -  
In country pubs and inns -  
In panel shows that tease and mock -  
In pies and double-chins.

We're great at making morning toast,  
Or eggs and bacon, beans -  
We morris dance, and like to boast  
Of commonwealths and queens.

We're best debating shades of skies,  
And how the day will be -  
Insult the French, apologise,  
And drink a lot of tea.  

And when it's cold and grey for days,  
And all that's left is rain -  
We're *excellent* at finding ways  
To sit and just... complain."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"He sat and sighed beside the road -  
His engine's gasket blown.  
His car was old and cold and towed.
  
The man was left alone.

'I need to find a place to stay  
Until it's fixed,' he spoke -  
But as he rose to walk away  
Arrived a band of folk.

They said: 'You're warmly welcome here  
To while away the night!  
We're godly *monks*, and living near -  
We walk the path of light.'

With thanks, the man inclined his head,  
And through the dusky gloom -  
He followed where the Abbot led,  
Who showed him to a room.

'Goodnight and fare thee well to you -  
Sleep tight!' the Abbot said.  
'And may your dreams be just and true,  
Inside your humble bed.'

But when he tried to sleep, he found  
A *noise* that started small -  
The most surprising, splendid sound  
Emerging through the wall.

It made him think of sirens song -  
The secret chimes of Mars -  
The shrouded space where dreams belong -  
The voice beyond the stars.

It made him think of hearts that yearn -  
The rhymes of wings unfurled -  
The passing beat of time to turn -  
The light beneath the world.

It made him think of love and peace -  
The silent bliss behind -  
The perfect place where problems cease  
To vex the waking mind.

The morning broke.  
The man awoke.  
'What was it, monks?' he cried.  
'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -  

'You're not a monk,' they sighed.

'But what a sense the sounds evoke!  
Oh tell me, friends!' he cried.   
'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -  

'You're not a monk,' they sighed. 

'I have to know!' the man explained,  
And so, without remorse -  
He joined the house, and prayed and trained,  
To find the noise's source.

He took the Test of Absent Bliss -  
The Woes of Anguish Drowned -  
He braved the Gulf of Faith's Abyss -  
And all to find the sound.

He stood before the Secret Sect -  
The Path of Rousing Ploys -  
He stepped the steps of Last Respect -  
And all to find the noise.

He crossed the Gate of Constant Grief -  
The Voids of Now and Then -  
He walked the Road of Lost Belief -  
To hear it once again.

And when he'd pained and strained and bled,  
And most his life had passed -  
'You're ready now,' the others said,  
'To see the source at last.'

They took him where the air was fair,  
And where, inside a *trunk...*  

I'd love to tell you what was there.

and don't forget  
A single part of it -

On every pic you click today -  
On every post,  
be cool -  
And never trust a word they say,  
Because...  

It's April, fool."

You can turn to face it never -

Feeling all the feelings worsen -  

Then I buy myself a person!    "

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;Everything's made up...

The things I think I thought I knew -  
The thoughts I thought I ought -  
I think, perhaps, were *not* so true  
As once I think I thought.  

I often thought the words I read  
On reddit, where they're shared -  
Were thoughts I thought inside my head,  
But never yet declared.  

But now I doubt these thoughts of mine,  
For now I've thought a bit -  
The thoughts I think I thought online  
Were often... full of shit.

'For you're shutting us down, and I want to know *why!*'

But some days are better than others,' he sighed.  

'There's squalor and sadness and sorrow and woe -  
There's demons that rise from the shadows below -  
There's dread and dismay and there's darkness as well -

For a moment while you're bleedin'  
And the ambulance you're needin'

Kinda selfish, narcissistic,  
To regret your occupation?

And papers, pots and pens, and more,  
Who I (and *you*, of course) adore,  
And simply smile to see.

He's sharp and smart and skilled and sweet,  
And swell at art and nice and neat,  
And few can match, and few compete,

He's world renowned and fondly famed,  
And much esteemed and much acclaimed,  
And greatly loved (and poorly named),  
And *this*, my friends, is he.

And I relish in the pleasure  
Of a witty interjection

That enlightenment's impeded  
When a jest of fine intention  
Takes the place of comprehension.  
  
See a story might be funny,  
Might be clever, might be punny,  
But it clouds appreciation  
For the earnest application  
Of the knowledge that we've weighted,  
Peer-reviewed and aggregated,  
And it leads me to consider... 

Why I'm not a bigger kidder.

'Get up!' he speaks in tears -  
'Get up!' I hear him sadly say,  
Confirming all my fears.

'I *can't*,' his mother softly sighs,  
'But know, before we part -  
Some things you'll see with *just* your eyes,  
And others, with your heart.'

The shadows stretch around them long -  
She lies in dust and soot.  
'Be brave,' she says, 'be safe, be strong.  
Be careful... Littlefoot.'

And in the years that passed between,  
I've kept a promise small -  
To never watch that *fucking scene*  
At any time.

His linen sheets and all -  
To much delight, he saw ahead  
A *hole* inside the wall.

A thousand thoughts infused his mind,  
And with an impish grin -  
He bent to look and spied behind  
The fluffy stuff within!

'It's cotton candy!' cried the boy,   
And reached a hand inside -  
And so, he ate his fill with joy.  

And Timmy fucking died."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Some parents are weaker than others,  
it's true.  
They're lost,  
and they won't always know what to do.  
They don't know the how, or the whether,  
the why.  
They doubt,  
but they do what they can and they try.

But others are *wilfully* weak,  
and aware.  
They know,  
but they're too fucking careless to care.  
They'll never reflect on their choices,  
and think.  
And one day,  
they'll kill both their kids for a drink."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;His parents do everything for him... 

I know that you care,  
and you do it for me -  
You hope that I'll be who you *want* me to be.  
You fret for my future,  
but don't understand -  
You're holding me back when you're holding my hand.

I know that you worry  
I'll end up alone -  
I know that you know that it's *hard* on your own.  
The moments of heartache,  
the setbacks, the strife -  
They're always a risk when you're leading a life.

I know that you think  
I'll be making mistakes -  
I'm ready to make them, if that's what it takes.  
I need you to listen -  
I need you to see -  
Whatever might happen, I have to be me.

And bounded down the boulevard.

It boomed and banged  
and slammed and smashed,  
And blast and clanged  
and clapped and crashed,  
Till all there was to hear was *WHY*. 

... I fucked it up. 

I want to die.  "

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Happy new year, /u/Donzo_!

Love Sprog 

:)

*

I could make a resolution,  
Turn a *present*  
to a *past* -  
But I've not the constitution,  
Nor the will to make it last.

I could push and struggle through it,  
Till I found the finer way -  
But I know I wouldn't do it  
Any longer than a day.

I could take a vice and spin it,  
Quit the call of wine and beer -  
But I'd never last a minute,  
Let alone another year.

I could make my contributions,  
But it's pretty clear to see -  
*I ain't made for resolutions.*

I'll just keep on being me!

His shower curtain blind -  
He stretched to reach the taps and found  
A *penis* just behind.

He sighed aloud and shook his head,  
Then shook the head some more.  

It gave his questing hand a poke -  
A stroke upon his limb -  
'I'd better get to work,' he spoke,  
'It's what's *expected*, Tim. 

'And who am I to disagree,  
Or lure and tempt and con?  
I think it's clear it's up to me -   
I'd hate to lead him on.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;Some Good Moments

You come to me,  
infrequently -  
I'll dream about your smile.  
It's late at night,  
and all is right,  
For just a little while.

You gave me this -  
this perfect bliss -  
This life I thought to lead.  
You see it's true,  
I knew with you,  
I'd everything I need.

But times have passed,  
and when, at last,  
I wake it's with regret.  
We weren't to be,  
but you and me,  
There's nights I won't forget."

Through the shows and 'toons I treasure  
Till you've nipple-sucked the pleasure,  
Spit and pooped your path of action,  
Through my sense of satisfaction.

TV baby, might I tell you,  
With delight I hope they sell you,  
Write you off, or pen your ending,  
Have you kidnapped, start pretending  
You were eaten by a dragon,  
Stolen for a merchant's wagon,  
Blended in the finest flavors,  
Gone to prison,  
sold to slavers.  

'Course, I'm not a malefactor -  
You're a tiny baby actor -  
And I know, it's not worth fighting,  
But it's just such *lazy writing.*  
Plot line thin for ladies, maybe?  
Have her have a fucking baby!  
Write 'em in, and while you're writing -
  
Write me something more exciting."

There's no way back from crime -  
Then what's the use in custody,  
Or doing *any* time?

If that's the point that *humans* end,  
And *criminals* begin -  
Why waste the time and means to spend  
To shut and keep them in?  

You might as well just end the life,  
If all its chance is gone -  
If all ahead is scorn and strife,  
Why work to carry on? 

There has to be a better way -  
Not *only* vengeance there.  
A chance to make a change today  
To fix,  
rebuild,  
repair.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"*Never wait for inspiration.*

Concentration's  
perspiration  
Matters more than furtive notions,  
Briefest thoughts and swift emotions.  

Make a start,  
and don't regret it -  
Here's the lesson,  
don't forget it -  
Pick yourself a pen and do it.

That's the only secret to it!  

Soon you'll find your inspiration  
Doesn't come from observation,  
Little, random moments fleeting,  
Rarely seen and not-repeating - 

Soon you'll find you're prepped to fake it -  
When you need it,  
then you'll make it!  
You've the passion and the pleasure -  
Fashion something sweet to treasure!

Writing isn't sweat and sinew -  
Only what you hold within you.  
Find yourself a destination.  

*Never wait for inspiration.*

And so, with a laugh and a grin and a sigh -

He turned on his printer. He said:

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy travelled time  
To nineteen-forty-five -  
He mapped and planned a ploy sublime;  
A *world* he'd try revive.

He planted pics of secret schemes -  
Of pre-historic day -  
Of sneaky Nazi science teams -  
Of sap and DNA.

And when the army found them out,  
And took the fated bait -  
He didn't fret. He didn't doubt.  
He settled back to wait.

... a dinosaur walked past his fence.  
He slowly, sadly sighed.  
'I should have known. They spared expense.'

And Timmy fucking died."

Munching eggs in *vast* excesses,

Eats around *four hundred weekly*.

'We were beautiful then,  
And I told you again  
That I'd love you in sunlight or snow -  
And I made you a ring  
With a circle of string  
From the flowers I tied in a bow.

'Will you love me,' you said,  
'When the flowers are dead,  
And our lingering shadows are long?'  
And I said that I would,

You're the snag on which I stumbled,  
And you're everything I need.  

You're the step I might have slipped on -  
You're the tread I missed, it's true -  
You're the tiny twist I skipped on,  
But I'm glad I tripped on you.

And you might have come from nowhere -  
And I'm sure I didn't see -  
But I know I want to go where  
You'll be in the way of me.

He opened up his eyes to see  
The world outside the womb.

He curled his teeny, tiny toes,

Alas, she hadn't done the test.

For this amiss delight.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When God was enjoying a wonderful day -  
He coloured the ocean, the sea and the spray.  
He peppered the planet with forests of trees -  
With sweet subtle scents on a warm summer's breeze. 

He crafted the kitten, and when he was done -  
Perfected the pup and the penguin for fun.  
He playfully reached in the depths of his mind -  
And found all the finest of Animal Kind.

'A *toast*,' he exclaimed, 'to the things that I've made!  
The creatures I've crafted, the plans that I've laid!'  
And so with fulfilment, content to his core,  
He knocked back a whiskey... and poured himself more.

The following morning he woke in a daze.  
He woke with a head full of headache and haze.  
He woke with a groan and a moan of distress.  
He woke and he rose, and his place was a *mess.*

The whiskey was empty.  
The cupboards were bare.  
He'd drank till the dawn of the morn in his chair.  
And when all his liquors had passed by his lip -  
He'd conjured a spirit for spirits to sip.

'Good Heavens,' he whispered, 'oh boy, what a night -  
At least nothing happened,' he said with delight.  
He walked to his workshop.  
He went for his key.  
He stared with dismay, and he said 'oh my *me.*'

His organised boxes of animal parts -  
The toes and the noses, the lungs and the hearts -  
He'd spilled them; he'd mixed them and filled them and split.  

He'd opened the box that said *Horrible Shit.*

'Oh Jesus,' said Jesus, from somewhere behind.  
'You've got to stop drinking each time you've designed!'  
But God heard the buzzing.  
He whispered with doubt:

'I'm sure that it's *nothing* to worry about...' "

But pretty soon it's plain to see,  
It methes up your day.

And if your friend is meth -  
Before you speak, I recommend  
You save your fucking breath.

Perhaps he imagines a planet of toys -  
A world full of fancy, or journeys and joys -  
A cosmos of castles and kites in the sky -  
Where mommy and daddy are always nearby.

Perhaps he imagines a ship on the seas -  
The wind and the waves as he rides on the breeze -  
The tide and the spray and the sword in his hand -  
The warmth of the day, and the sun and the sand.

I lean where he silently lays on his front.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I am a Man.  
I do not cry.  
I do not cry to say goodbye.  
I do not cry to think of me,  
Alone, afraid of what might be.

I do not cry for who I knew,  
Or what I know became of you.  
I do not cry to pay the cost  
Of who I've loved to love and lost.

I do not cry at soppy scenes,  
Or stories told in magazines,  
Or just because, in times of doubt,  
I need to let my feelings out.

I do not cry for who I was,  
Or who I am,  
or just because...  
A *thousand* other reasons why.  

I am a Man.  
I do not cry.

Discontent and contradiction,

Spare a page that all can be on.

Still, I'm glad to find delighted

Lift your pizza, lips a-pucker!

He only saw the face of it.

And broken arms to no surprise;

Had spilled a stanza, fair and free,  
For all to witness:

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Can't they see the shadows creeping?  
Can't they sense the space behind?  
Faded shades of darkness seeping  
Through the murk and 'round the mind?

Can't they feel them through the under?  
Can't they hear them in the night?  
Clenching, wrenching sounds asunder,  
Speaking words of pain and plight?

Can't they feel the clutching, clasping,  
Clawing scratch of fingers grasping?  
Will they miss them?  
Will they mourn them?

Someone... someone has to warn them."

And you've lies on your tongue and you've tricks up your sleeves!

'Oh you *say* it's the terms of the coupon,' she said,  
'But I know you're to blame, and I wish you were *dead!*  
Pay attention!' she said, as she hollered behind:  
'For they're shamelessly, brazenly robbing you blind!

'You are *hatefully* heinous, malignant and mean,  
And you're evil and awful and all in  between!  
You're a *sinner!*' she screamed, 'and a *scammer!*' she cried,  
So I flashed her a smile, and I simply... complied.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"There's nothing more scary,  
or simply insane -  
More deeply disturbing,  
and hard to explain -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"This world isn't easy -  
It's hard on your own -  
We're richer united,

It's fine to ignore it -  
For better or ill -  
To scorn it before it  
collapses your will.

But if you can *fight* it -  
Or choose to be *strong* -   
Perhaps you can right it,  
repairing a wrong.

It's plainly apparent -  
It's simple to see -  
Together,  
we'll weather  
whatever will be.

Swords and shields and trysts and tourneys,

Rolling seas and dark diseases -

Worlds of feasts and feats and actions,  
Sands and lands of foes and factions,

No changes it made.   

'But *what* could have happened?' he said with a sigh.  
He pondered the reasons, the *how*, and the *why.*  
The *posts* he was missing; the *clicks* he'd unclicked -  
The threads that were waiting, unused and unpicked.

He waited.  
He waited.  
He waited with dread.

A creeping sensation arose in his flesh.  
He shuddered with horror.  

He hit the 'refresh.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I wish I could say that you'll learn to move on -  
That sorrow today will tomorrow be gone -  
That storms go away, and the clouds disappear -  
That time will diminish a mind full of fear.

I wish I could say it will all be okay -  
That even the darkest of nights turn to day -  
That problems are fleeting, and easily passed -  
That nothing unpleasant's intended to last.

I wish I could swear it from somewhere below -  
That's not how it works, and I know that you know.  
And though it's a strain and a struggle to cope -  
We just have to do it. We have to have *hope.*

'The *basement*,' he promised, and pulled at an ear.  
A sentence of whispers I struggled to hear.  
A grumble of mumbles obscured in a breath.  
A word from a murmur that might have been *death.*

'Go down to the basement,' he said with a smile.  
'Go *down* to the basement,' he whispered with guile.

Map retreats and marshal factions,  
Start a chart of counteractions...

Figures moving, shadows nearing...  
Whispers at the edge of hearing...  
Rushing feet and raving faces...  

Plastic darts in all the places.

Of a tumble under wonders  
In the search for ancient gold -  
Of a trek towards a treasure,  
And a step on olden sands -  
Of a distance you can measure  
With your feet and with your hands.
   
There are stories made in murmurs  
And they're spoken soft and slow -  
Of a night descending gently,  
And a light that shines below -  
Of a love uncomplicated,  
And a promise made to keep -  
There are stories in the silence  
As they drift away to sleep."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Shadows through the ceiling, seeping,  
Crawling walls and cautious creeping,  
Waiting, creaking, pausing, peeking,  
Watching, slowly, softly-speaking...  

Whispers through the dark, enclosing,  
Slow suggestions, soft supposing,  
Scares and shocks and shudders, shivers,  
Quiet qualms and quavers, quivers...

There I lie in apprehension,  
Twisted pleats in sheets of tension,  
Shaken, taken, trapped in sorrow.

... Hope he's coming back tomorrow.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I know what he's thinking -  
He's thought it before.  
He stares for a moment,  
a minute, or more.  
Suspicions unspoken -  
Hypothesis hid.  
I lean in towards him,  
and whisper: *'I did.'* "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I gave them my number and check-book,' he cried:   
'Reports of transactions with figures inside!  
My personal info! My monthly amount!  
My condo's address and my checking account!  

'I gave them my books and my balance and keys -  
My codes and my card when they asked with a 'please'!  
The place I was born, and the date, and my name -  
'My password,' I told them, 'it's always the same!'

'I gave them my answers to questions online -  
The secret replies and responses of mine!  
I gave them,' he sighed, with a shake of his head:  

'And somehow, and *somehow*, they *hacked* me,' he said.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;Additional verse:

... But all the same, it seems a shame,  
To aim for lofty peaks -  
And skip the sordid songs of fame,  
Entitled *'Vargas Speaks'.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"You may wonder the *when*, and you'll wonder again  
For the *how* and the *why* and the *who* -  
You'll imagine the *way*, the occasion and day,  
And you'll ask for the *what* when you do -

But as most things in life, be it husband or wife,  
We arrive at the question you've got -   
And it isn't the *where* or the *this* or the *there*,  
But the matter at hand:

Was she hot?"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The fairest words are made for rhyme,  
A line, a stanza sweet -  
An ode bestowed for all of time,  
And bound beside the beat.

The fairest words can ride the tides  
Inside the minds of men -  
To last the past; to close divides;  
To come around again.

'A summer's day', 'a winter's night',   
A rhyme 'to seek, to find' -  
'To know, at end, the dark is right',  
And more before, behind.

Where suns are 'crimson bright' sublime,  
And heaven shines 'too hot' -  
The fairest words are made for rhyme...
  
And other words are *not.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Happy monthly cycle, feeling  
Bloated, poorly, unappealing,  
Unattractive,  
Under-rested,  
Tried and tense, and tender-breasted!  

'Happy uninvited bleeding!  
You're superb, and you're succeeding!'  
So the sayings say it snappy.

Back and forth it tossed and tumbled,

Smashed on mashers, masticated...

Darkly dressing -  
Something sudden,  
So distressing.  
Interruption.  
Lights are glaring.  
And I'm naked.

he made no defense.  
I taunted, undaunted,

Just be sure  
the number's odd."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"The desert was barren and arid and dry -  
The sun was a sweltering orb in the sky.  
The dunes were a tide of impassible height -  
They stretched like an ocean of chroma in light.

He stood and he stared at the glare from the sand -  
He shaded the flare of the light with his hand.  
His path was forgotten; his rations were few -  
He'd gathered enough for a morning or two.

But friends, was he worried?  
Oh no, not at all.  
He took, from his baggage, a package, though small.  
He shuffled in silence, and started, and sat.

A voice said behind him: '... I wouldn't do *that.*' "

'It's just the cashier from your bank checking in!  
Your balance is perfect,' he started to say -  
'Precisely the same as it was yesterday!  

'Your cash has been counted and sorted and stacked!  
Your vaults have been tallied and totalled and packed!  
Your money's a mountain, but maybe, what's more -  
It makes the same number it made up before!

I shall only encounter the future in dreams -  
But at least I have memes.

'There's tons of diseases, and no extra health -  
There's too many needs, and a shortage of wealth.  
There's debt and there's bills and there's taxes and more -  
I worked for forever, and still I was poor!  

'There's only one mode, and it's 'Fatally Hard' -  
You leave it disordered and mentally scarred!  
The crimes and the wars and the wrongs are obscene -  
Achievements are few and infrequent between!

Poem_for_your_sprog,"If mornings are boring and dreary and dull -  
You're stuck in a rut, or a grind, or a lull -  
Your days are mundane, and your nights are the same -  
Your world's unexciting, and aimless, and lame -  

If customs and habits reprise and repeat -  
You know every inch in your town and your street -  
You're sick of routine and your dreaming of more -  
You rue what you do for you've done it before -  

If life is a journey to nowhere, and slowed -  
You furtively look for a fork in the road -  
You hope for a curve, or a twist, or a bend...  
Then follow your dreams where they take you, my friend."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'But if it's *love*,' the judge remarked,  
And shook his weary head:  
'And if the flames of hearts are sparked,  
And filled with such,' he said -

'Then who am *I* to stand averse  
In face of such delight?  
And what is bad, and what is worse,  
And what is wrong or right?

'You must be wed,' he sighed with pride,  
And said: 'We'll find a way!  
You're free!' he spoke; 'you're free,' he cried...  

'If only for a day.'

Regarded reasons new:  
'Alas,' he said, and shook his head,  
'... I didn't think this through.' "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'And so you see,' he spoke and sighed,  
'It wasn't *really* me -  
I couldn't know,' he said with pride,  
'Precisely where she'd be.

'It wasn't part of any plan  
To crush the car below -  
And is it just to blame a man

For things I didn't *mean* to do?'

But if your mind is *never* shut -  
And if you *always* trust your gut -  
Remember, when you feel it loop...  

Perhaps you only need to poop."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"You feel it beneath you, or somewhere behind -  
The pit of your stomach, the back of your mind.  
A thought or a feeling that doesn't belong -  
The strangest sensation that *something is wrong.*

It comes in an instant, and lingers about -  
A twist of suspicion, a trickle of doubt.  
A feeling remaining a moment or two -  
A vague understanding of *what might be true.*

So open your mind if it's stubborn or shut -  
And trust the emotions that start in your gut.  
It might just be nothing, that notion you've got -  
It might be mistaken... but maybe it's *not.* "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Blind confusion,  
fear unthinking,  
Floating, swept and soaking, sinking -  
Scratching, scraping,  
each sensation,  
Deepest, darkest, isolation.

Murmurs, mumbles,  
gasping, groaning,  
Boundless cries and mourning moaning -  
Weeping, leaking,  
shifting, creaking,  
Waters rolling, silence speaking.  

There you lie inside its clutches,  
Lapped and trapped in frozen touches.  

All your days are far behind you.  

No one knows the way to find you."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Her beauty,' he pondered; 'her beauty,' he said -  
'... Was fruity?' he tried, with a shake of his head -

'... Was *booty*?' he started,  
and started again.

'Her beauty was really, amazingly... well -  
It sort of was super, and making him... swell?'  
He buried his head in his hands with a sigh.  
He pondered improvements,  
and gave them a try.

'Her beauty was flawless - but that's not enough -  
Her face was a vision of grace and of... stuff?  
Her skin was the shade and the colour of... spam?  
Her hair was a fancy,  
a picture of... *damn*!'  

And when he was finally finished at last -  
When ages of pages and pages had passed -  
When lines were completed, repeated, and read -  
He nodded, contented.  

'It's *perfect,*' he said.
     "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'If booty's the beauty you're seeking to find,  
Begin your adventures below and behind!  
Go plunder the under with all that you've got!  
The treasure's the pleasure, and X marks the spot!'   "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He sadly sat beside the road;  
His engine's gasket blown -  
His car was old and cold and towed;  
The man was left alone.

'I need to find a place to stay  
Until it's fixed,' he spoke -  
But when he rose to walk away,  
Arrived a band of folk.

'You're truly warmly welcome here  
To while away the night -  
We're monks,' they said, 'and living near,  
As well as brothers might.'

With thanks, the man inclined his head,  
And through the dusky gloom -  
He followed where the Abbot led,  
Who showed him to a room.

But when he tried to sleep, he found  
A noise that started small -  
The most surprising, splendid sound  
Emerging through the wall.

It made him think of sirens song -  
The secret chimes of Mars -  
The shrouded space where dreams belong -  
The voice beyond the stars.

It made him think of love and peace -  
The hidden world behind -  
The perfect place where problems cease  
To vex the waking mind.

The morning broke.  
The man awoke;  
'What was it, monks?' he cried.  
'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -  
'You're not a monk,' they sighed. 

'I have to know!' the man explained,  
And so, without remorse -  
He joined the house, and prayed and trained,  
To find the noise's source.

He took the Test of Absent Bliss;  
The Woes of Anguish Drowned -  
He braved the Gulf of Faith's Abyss -  
And all to find the sound.

And when he'd pained and strained and bled,  
And most his life had passed -  
'You're ready now,' the others said,  
'To see the source at last.'

They took him where the air was fair,  
And where, inside a *trunk*...  

I'd love to tell you what was there.
  
Alas, you're not a monk."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He glared and stared beyond the bed,  
With eyes of bleakest blue -  
A tiny 'stache above the spread;  
A risky rendezvous.  

And though I *knew* it wasn't right,  
I felt excitement stir -  
For if it meant I spent the night,  
I'd do it all fur her.
 "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There's no earthly way of knowing,  
Which direction she is blowing -  
There's no knowing  
where she's blowing,  
Or which way the semen's flowing -  

Is he cumming, is he going?  
Are the seeds of pleasure sowing?  
Not a sign of woe is showing,  
So his member must be growing.  

Are the fires of lusts a-glowing?  
Is it almost overflowing?  

Yes, his member must be growing,  
For the goer keeps on going,  
And she's certainly not showing  
Any signs that she is slowing...

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"In candles surrounding the big-top at night,  
She came to the scene in the carnival light!  
She waited expectant in joy and in glee  
To see if she'd see what she wanted to see!  
(The garlicy wonders and marvels they'd found,  
They'd sourced, it was said, from the world all around) -  
And so, with the ring of a fifty-foot gong,  
The carnival opened to let in the throng!

Inside there were cannons with nets far below,  
And garlic-shaped see-saws all set for the show!  
A dozen trapezes on riggings up high,  
And hundreds of clowns throwing pie after pie!  
She looked all around as the sound of the crowd  
Half-dwindled and dimmed till it wasn't so loud -  
And there, through the smoke came a man from inside -  
The ringmaster smiling, who bowed down and cried:

'Sing with your fingers and smile with your toes-es!  
Laugh at the gibbons in ribbons and bows-es!  
Wonder and marvel at mice spinning dishes!  
Clap for the songs of the silver-scaled fishes!  
Watch as the elephants stand on their trunkies!  
Roar with the lions and howl with the monkeys!  
Garlic is waiting, and garlic you'll taste -  
Savour the flavour, and try it with haste!'  

The crowd was ecstatic - they cheered, satisfied!  
The ringmaster flourished and vanished inside!  
And from every rafter it suddenly seemed,  
As though from a sleep that we all of us dreamed,  
A million garlics descending from high,  
The shape of the stars in the Milky-Way sky,  
Had tumbled and fell like a sweet-smelling mist -  
And grandma, poor grandma, just couldn't resist.

She just had a nibble;  
She just had a bite;  
A nip and a gnaw with a dash of delight;  
A chomp and a chew,  
And another, or four -  
Another, another, another, and more!  
Before she had known it, she'd eaten a clove -  
A greenhouse of garlic, a garden, a grove!  
She'd fed and she'd feasted; she'd gorged and consumed...  
And grandpappy Timmy, poor grandpa, was *doomed.*

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy grew in years,  
And life was almost through -  
He shed his former faults and fears,  
And swore to live anew!

He steered a ship beyond the seas,  
And sailed on stormy tides -  
He madly, gladly rode the breeze  
On roller-coaster rides!  

He went to see the Northern Lights,  
The Taj Mahal, the Queen -  
The most-amazing-famous-sights  
Above, below, between!

He lived his life and more to boot,  
And when he'd aged with pride -  
He took a leap without a 'chute.  

And Timmy fucking died."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Temptation comes in many shapes,  
And many forms between -  
A light delight, or small escapes  
From life's mundane routine. 

Temptation's often sweet, but still  
Your choices take their toll -  
And life is meant to teach you will,  
And strength and self-control.

Temptation's hard to check - to wit:  
Temptation's tough to fight.  
But as you're not a piece of shit,  
You'll try to choose what's *right*.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He spoke and stood and stared ahead -  
The man who'd journeyed far.  
'There are no pedos *here*,' she said.  

He whispered: 'Yes there are.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Oh dearest dad,' he thought to say:  
'There's no one smart as you.  
But when you go to work all day,   
What is it there you do?

'Samantha's father runs a lab,  
And Simon's dad's a cop -  
Christina's drives a taxi-cab,  
And Sarah's owns a shop!

'Is yours the same,' he spoke and sighed,  
'Or is it something *fun*?'  
His father smiled and said with pride:  
'I steal from grandmas, son.' "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The day they named the Unicorn -  
They *missed* the Rhino there.  
They saw the shape;  
They saw the horn;  
They stopped, amazed, to stare.

'But what to *call* a hefty horse,  
Adorned with horny head?  
Perhaps,' they pondered proud, 'of course!  
A Uni-Horn!' they said.

But time and chances change a name,  
And fables come to be -  
The legend found its rightful fame...  
Though Rhinos disagree.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*They say that hell is other folk,*  
*But no one seems to see:*  
*It's worse than endless pain and smoke -*  

*It's pearsonal to me.*     "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"They came through the ceiling!  
They came through the floor!  
They came through the windows, the hallway, the door!  
They came through the chimney!  
They came through the wall!  
They came through the fixtures and fittings and all!

They came and they dangled and drooped and they dropped!    
They came and they fell and they floundered and flopped!  
They came in their hundreds!  
They came in a heap!  
They came in a mountain I hastened to sweep!  

And when I had seen all the boobs I could take -  
The big ones, the small ones, the full, and the fake -  
The endless appearance of bosoms ahead -  
I pondered a moment.   

'It's worth it,' I said."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Be true to you, I've heard it said -  
Be brave, and pave your way -  
And never choose to change instead

But if I'm who I'm meant to be,  
And nothing more will do -  
Then why does no one think of me  
The way I think of you?

As I lay in silent wonder,  
Thoughts emerge and wander under:  
'Is tonight the night I hear it?  
Will I face it?  
Will I fear it?'  

Softly, slowly do I slumber,  
Counting sheep in countless number,  
Till, at last, I hear the creaking,  
Groaning sounds of floorboards speaking.

Something moving,  
something muffled,  
Something through the bathroom shuffled;  
Something *haunting*,  
something *heinous*...  

Coming from my husband's anus.

You've faults and fleas abound -  
And close inspections indicate  
A nasty case of *Hound.*

'There's mounds of matts beside your back,  
And each demands a clean -  
Your teeth are black, and full of plaque,  
With bits of food between!

the space in-between -  
A shape in the darkness;  
a shade on the screen.

It went to the cradle,  
and said: *daddy's here...*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Life is hard, but this I've learned:  
Pennies saved are pennies earned!  
Dollars stashed, or kept in store,  
Swiftly mount to more and more!

Dime by dime, or cent by cent -  
Each is better saved than spent!  
Thrift is fun, and gain's the aim -  
Growth is good, but all the same:  

Though it's sad to see it lost -  
Some expense is worth the cost.  
Friends and neighbours, here's the thing:  

*Life's too short for shit to sting.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I sat in my bedroom, and strummed at a tune -

To sporting success on a broom in the sky...  
To Eros alone in the sight of the stars...  
To space on a ship that's intended for Mars.

You don't need a mountain of money to go -  
Where Peter and Susan await in the snow...  
Where planets contend and defend for a spice...  
Where Alice adventures with Hatters and mice.
 
You don't need a wallet of wealth and of worth -  
To start on a journey across Middle-Earth...  
To fight in the night with your sword and your steed.  

You don't need a fund or a fortune to *read.*"

I can't return the time we lose -

To hear her answer true:  
'Divinely aged and bold and best

The cellar, dear,' she said."

'Twas night, and the children were dreaming their dreams -  
Of mustards and custards and cookies and creams!  
Of trips to the future, and ships to the stars!  
Adventures to Saturn, and journeys to Mars!  

They turned in their slumber and peacefully slept -  
But down through the kitchen, a shadow had crept!  
It crept through the stairway; it crept through the hall -  
It crept through the bedroom, and stopped at the wall!

'I'm waiting,' a whisper emerged from within -  
'It's time to delight in a night full of sin!  
The children are sleeping; the husband's away -  
I'm willing and wanton and wanting to play!

'The love of another is precious to find -  
But better's the lusts of an *other* in kind!  
Excite me, delight me, and better I'll be -  
Fulfil me and fill me, instil me with glee!'

And so, with a tickle, a whimper, a sigh -  
The crack of a whip and a moan and a cry -  
She treasured the pleasure, and saw it was true.

A Who likes to do who a Who likes to do."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Twas late in the fifties, enacting a plan,  
When troubles were started, and problems began.  
The Communist Party of China would say:

'It's time for a leap to the here and the now!  
And if there's resistance,' he thought to explain,  
'We'll purge with the fair anti-rightist campaign!  

'Exclusive production is bad for the soul -  
And isn't it better to work as a whole?  
It's truly unruly, and duly, I feel -  
We're better investing in grain and in steel!  

'Let's shake-up and make-up a future, my friends -  
And when the adventure succeeds in its ends,  
We'll build a new China!' he said with a sigh. 

'Of course though, a shit-load of people will die.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Okay,' said the Chairman, 'so maybe,' he spoke,  
'The ""Four Pests Campaign"" wasn't *perfect* for folk.  
But maybe,' he sighed with a shake of his head,  
'The next operation will fix it!' he said.

'Forget all the harvests, the workshops, the schools -  
Collect your equipment and gather your tools!  
Assemble!' the Chairman was heard to espouse:  
'Begin the production of steel in your house!'

And so, with commotion, confusion, delight -  
They struggled by day, and they strained in the night!  
They drudged and they labored, and when they were done -  

The peasants were poorer than when they'd begun.

And slips betwixt his anal cheeks,

As sliding stops to swells of shit  
That gush and flood and roll and flow  
Above, behind, and back, below,  
From side to side, and door to door,  
Forevermore forevermore!

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Actual Christmas rhyme for you :)

'Twas midnight when the bells were rung,  
And all the Christmas songs were sung  
In sight of softly falling snow  
That dropped and drifted down below,  
Where people watched with hope and glee  
To spy the scene they'd dreamed to see -

The Christmas light;  
the town awoke,  
And through the clouds of chimney smoke,  
They looked above to see the sleigh  
That upped and rose and rolled away,  
And with a merry, laughing call,  
He cried: 'Goodnight, to one and all!'

They watched him go;  
they shared a smile;  
They warmed their hands, and for a while,  
There were no gripes; there were no grumps;  
There were no doubts or Donald Trumps;  
There were no fears; there were no ends -  
But only love, and only friends.

And so, to one, to all, and more,  
For all ahead, and all before,  
With festive fun, and winter rhyme - 

A very merry Christmas time!

Hungry hearts that start to weaken -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"At the bridge, at the bridge, where the air is thin,  
And the mist descends and the dreams begin,  
And the waters flow,  
And the waters grow,  
And the waters whisper, soft and slow...

At the bridge, at the bridge, where you walk alone,  
And the tracks are dust and the steps are stone,  
And the edge is near,  
And the edge is fear,  
And the edges, made in shade, appear...

And the mist descends,  
And your steps are stone,  
And the tracks are dust,  
And you walk alone,   
And the water flows,  
And the dreams begin,  
At the bridge,  
at the bridge,  
where the air is thin..."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Want to drive your cutie crazy?  
Send her horny, hot and hazy?  
Lewd and lustful?  
Wet and waiting?  
Try a bout of lady-baiting!

Slowly losing satisfaction?  
Get her friends to join the action!  
Ask her sister, add relations!  
Dress her up like animations!  

Need her swiftly screaming louder?  
Spice it up with chili powder!  
If your sweetie starts objecting,  
Take her when she's unsuspecting!  

Slosh your schlong and let her savor!  
Dunk your dick in every flavor!  
Take a peek and tweak pudenda!  
Reassert your manly gender!  

Grow your nails, and even maybe,  
Grab her by the pussy, baby!  
Ride her like an oxen-drover!

Ask forgiveness when it's over."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"She laughed with a smile and a shake of her head -  
'That's *funny!*' she giggled: 'you're *funny!*' she said.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy went to school,  
He grinned with glee to find -  
That Science Club was kinda cool,  
And worth the wait behind.

'I always thought that school was *lame*,'  
He told his teacher, glad:  
'But now, you know, I'm pleased I came -  
Perhaps it's not so bad.'

His teacher laughed and slowly smiled.  
He kindly, softly sighed:  
'IT'S TIME TO MEET THE HALBERD, CHILD.'

And Timmy fucking died."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Couplets, verses, rhymes and meter -  
Lines are fine, but sonnets sweeter!  
Stanza-seizing,  
tempo-teasing -  
Sounds and words and phrases pleasing!

Rhythm rising, falling, flowing -  
Poesies piled and gathered, growing -  
Word-connection  
predilection,  
Rolling, rhyming-interjection!  

Beat and cadence calculations -  
Structured stresses, intonations -  
Satisfying  
prose-denying,  
Little-Timmy-fucking-dying!

Rhyming, writing quite contented.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"They tell me she's sprightful, delightful, and sweet;  
A pleasure to treasure from fingers to feet -  
The fondest and fairest to savor and see;  
Divinely and finely refined as can be - 

They tell me she's lovely, a lady of lust;  
That many a suitor has boomed for her bust -  
Bodacious, flirtatious, rapaciously wild;  
Exciting, inviting an evening beguiled.

They call her the siren; the cock-chomping-chick;  
The princess of penis; the damsel of dick;  
A fan of the phallus; a ball-hungry-bomb -  
They call her *seductress*... but I call her mom."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"You'll pick your perfect point of view;  
You'll disregard the rest -  
You'll know that only yours is true;  
You'll know that yours is best.  

You'll blindly feed the frame of mind  
That keeps you feeling right -  
You'll overlook the facts they find;  
The proofs that come to light.  

You'll hold your old perspectives strong,  
And safe behind a wall -  
You'll never feel as though you're wrong.
  
You'll never learn at all.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"If you can always make a choice  
For them, and not for *you* -  
To keep them safe and give them voice,  
When times are troubled too -

If you can meet and know their needs,  
To hold them free from pain -  
Or guide them through when pain succeeds,  
And help to bear the strain -

If you can hope to never part,  
And swear inside you won't -  
Then raise a child and share your heart.  
 
But if you can't... then don't."

This jacket made of pain.  
So won't you spend some time with me?'

... they kicked me off the plane."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Though catapults obtain results  
In any given war -  
A trebuchet, I like to say,  
Is capable of *more.*

'A suited sling is quite the thing  
For hurling lumps of stone -  
A counterweight is twice as great  
Than wood and springs alone!

'They're big, it's true, but mighty too,  
And that is why, you see -  
That in the end, my finest friend,  
It's trebuchets for me.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Steamy streaming,  
water weeing.  
Power-shower  
secret peeing.  
Salt secreting  
sprightly sprinkles.  
Shrouded ripples,  
clouded tinkles.

Sly location  
urination.  
Incognito  
dissipation.  
Quirky, perky,  
all-direction  
imperfection  
piss-projection!

Hazy, crazy,  
soaked and swirling,  
water down the plug-hole whirling!  
Easy-peasy,  
nothing to it!  

But I'd never,  
ever,  
do it.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"The hardest lessons learned in life  
Are dealt and earned with grief -  
A hundred spans of pain and strife;  
A stretch of lost belief.

Or how, and who's to blame -  
It comes around, and comes again,  
And always hurts the same.

I've failed a thousand times before.

I'd rather fail a thousand more

Poem_for_your_sprog,"The finest, fairest things in life

For acts that bring you bliss -  
To live, my friend, and not discard

Be true, be you, and just enjoy

I write in regard to a cheat.  
While reading a thread on a subreddit sweet,  
I witnessed a comment delightful to see:  
'How merry,' I whispered, and giggled with glee.

'Twas then I decided to honour the line  
With something delightfully precious of mine -  
A creddit I'd savoured and saved for a while -  
A golden allowance, bestowed with a smile.

What phonies and fraudsters your redditors make!  
Return me my creddit, I really insist.

Sincerely, a victim of forgery, pissed.'"

Bumping, thumping, traipsing, tramping,  
Falling thunder, over, under,  
Silence stripped and swept asunder -

Through the room they paced and pounded,  
Beefy feet that beat and bounded,  
Hefty hooves that rolled and rumbled,  
Super steps that strolled and stumbled -

Soaring, veering, closer, nearing,  
Roaring, fractured-flooring, fearing,  
Soon-appearing, rowdy-romper - 

Rhino Feet, the office stomper."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy tried it too,  
He found, in pain and plight -  
No matter what he thought to do,  
He couldn't do it *right*.

He pursed his lips by dusk and day,  
And sighed inside, and soon -  
He huffed and puffed in every way,  
At morning, night, and noon!

'I'll have to try it *twice* as strong -  
A last attempt!' he cried.  
But Timmy held his breath too long.

And Timmy fucking died."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"If you would care to spare your heart,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"If I could cruise the past and choose  
Across the sands of time -  
I know the dame I'd deign to name,  
To spend a night, sublime.

She's famed and crowned the world around,  
By dusk, by dawn, by day -  
The first in line, but twice divine

My only pick: the Queen."

Bottles full of frothy fluids.  
Bibles blessed by pasty preachers,

Missing teeth and extra digits,  
Monkey skulls and massive midgets.  
Woken hopes and secrets spoken,  
Bonds corrupted, pledges broken.

Half-imagined dreams of danger,  
Teeny tiny slips of stranger.  
Strange emotions, nasty notions,  
Pink and purple putrid potions.  

Bits of paper, paper flowers,  
Little spots of April showers.  
Capers kept and framed for dreaming,  
Sunlight through the window streaming.

Rotten, long-forgotten curses,  
Sonnets, stanzas, rhymes and verses.  
Lies, goodbyes, and misdirections.  

None of these are my collections."

In stanzas, small and sweet.

I am the secret silver seams  
That weave inside your mind.  
I am the lost and tender dreams

Or choose in rhyme and verse -  
In making something *not-okay*,

But then it meant I dropped taboos  
On things that *need* them too.

And that is *you*, O.P.  
You'll never get away with this.  

You've made the final three.

I've often read the perfect thread,  
And smiled at what may come -  
Like if it's 'gif' or 'gif' instead,

I've had the chance to share a thought,  
And savored every time -  
And even more than any ought

God remained a sour outsider.  

God got eaten by a spider.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"If roses are red as your kisses goodbye -  
If violets are blue as the hue in your eye -  
If roses are *red*,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Your giant robots hold the coast.  
Your cruisers sail the seas.  
Your soldiers wait at every post,  
And bombers fly the breeze.

Your wonders stand in every space.  
Your savings surge in stores.  
Your cities grow in every place,  
And all the land is yours.  

Your map's the hue and shade of *you.*  
You're watching 'Eden' burn.  
There's nothing more that He can do. 
 
He says: 'Just one more turn...'
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Please welcome, Sylvester -  
He's injured, but healing.  
He wants to relate to you  
How he's been feeling.'  
'My sweetheart,' he whispered -  
'A cheat and impugner.  
A faker.  
A phony.  

*A secret ballooner.'*  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Fewer things are more perturbing,  
More distressing,  
More disturbing,  
Disconcerting,  
Vile and vexing,  
Daunting, haunting, half-perplexing,  
Nauseating,  
Aggravating,  
Misbegotten, rotten, grating,  
Frightful,  
Sad,  
And simply chilling -  
Than a load of kitten killing.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"It started with stories;  
With words and a smile.  
Awaiting your answers,  
And reading a while;  
Expecting perspectives,  
By day and by night -  
It started with talking,  
And talking till light.

It started with hearts,  
And it started, it seems -  
With passion, perfection,  
And half-finished dreams.  
It started with hopes,  
And with love-laden sighs...  
And ended with silence,  
And   
*One*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"He washed his cat.  
He cleaned his car.  
He spun in circles, near and far.  
He showered up.  
He sprinkled down.  
He went and wet the streets to town.  
 
He splished.  
He splashed.  
He sploshed.  
He sprayed.  
He slopped and dropped and when he'd made  
A tiny flood -  
A teeny flow -  
He spilled a little more below.

'Whatever next?'  
His wife exclaimed.  
'You've used the lot!'  
She spoke, ashamed.  
And so he smiled,  
And said, sincere:  
'I'm doing what they told me, dear.'"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Contorted lines of cables creep,  
And cross suspended beams -  
A silent form you see in sleep;  
A shape you fear in dreams.

It curves and bows in tarnished steel,  
And hangs, inert, below -  
But something *stirs* inside, you feel.  
A light begins to glow. 

The shadows shift their silhouette,  
And circuits fire anew.  
You hear the voice you can't forget.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"At least on this, we both agree:  
And so abhorrence starts -  
A youth of hate's a recipe

You raise them up and leave a scar;  
A mind behind, it's true -  
They take the best of all you are,  
And all the *worst* of you.

And so I'll raise a glass instead -  
Perhaps you'll take a cup.

To vote for folks like...

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young,  
And full of youth,  
And sure of what I knew -  
I always pushed my chosen truth,  
And pressed my point of view.

The truth was *mine* alone to see,  
And 'facts' were *mine* to state -  
When nothing beat, it seemed to me,  
An apt and bold debate.

I claimed a wiser wit before,  
But now I've aged I find -  
I much prefer to *listen* more,  
And *not* to change a mind.

I've grown to learn that *no one* knows,  
And nothing's black or white -  
Except the way the paper goes.  
It's *over*.  
Get it right.

You move to move your hand away,  
But something holds you *tight.*

The waters grow, and waters flow,  
Beneath the dark and deep.  
You slowly ride the tide below,   
And drown,  
and dream,

For everywhere's a creepy freak,  
Who'd love a piece of *you.*'

He spread his name with pride.  
And Timmy shared his home address.

And Timmy fucking died.

Arose anew the sound of Hell.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;And it's only by the decisions you make that you're able to survive.

If I should strive to seek the end,  
And fail and fade, or fall -  
It only takes inaction, friend,  
To bring an end to all.

It wouldn't take an ounce of strain  
To let it simply cease -  
And every shred of doubt and pain  
Would pale and pass with peace.

And yet, my friend - I never fear,  
Nor fold before the force;  
For every time the end is near,  
I choose to stay the course."

For all we paupers fear;  
Without a thought for all he ought

He left it cold - and amber-gold,  
A tan and tempered tide;  
The finest gift unseemly stiffed  
And rashly cast aside.

He left it whole - and left it sole,  
And soulless, on the brink;  
And so we rose with angry throes...  

And fell upon his drink.

'Of course you can!' his father said,  
And laughed with rich delight -  
'It's only right to plot ahead,  
And plan your path by flight!'

So Timmy left without a doubt,  
And landed, flushed with pride.  
But Timmy leaped too highly out.  

And Timmy fucking died."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"From Turkey to Thailand;  
From Sweden to Spain;  
From Texas to Georgia,  
Montana to Maine;  
From Papua New Guinea  
To west of Peru -  
He studied his subject, and searched for it through.

From charters to patents;  
From rubbers to molds;  
From little wee duckies  
In yellows and golds;  
From mills and to markets,  
And decades by day -  
He sought a solution, and searched for a way.

He started with Ernie -  
And ended alone.  
A profitless journey  
Of life on his own.  
'It's over,' he whispered,  
'If just for a while...  
*But one day I'll make you*,' he swore with a smile."

For tiny helpless boys -  
We have to make a safer space;  
A shielded life of joys!

'There's evil beasts at every bend,  
And danger waits ahead!  
It has to *stop.* It has to *end.*  
He can't go out!' she said.

'Oh dearest darling wife of mine,'  
The other whispered, sad:  
'Just let him go - and he'll be *fine*,'  
Said Little Timmy's dad."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'You need,' she said, 'to set me free,  
And look for *her* instead!

'It's just a random twist of chance,  
Entwined and caught in crime -  
And though it's strange, at second glance,  
It happens all the time!

'And so,' she cried, and stood with pride:  
*'Let innocence prevail!'*  
He shook his head and sadly sighed,  
And hauled her ass to jail."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy fucking died,  
And in the *After*, woke -

'I'm sorry lad - it's looking bad,'  
He blew a breathless breath;  
'You didn't *plan*,' he whispered, sad -  
'You didn't *save* for death.

'It's gonna cost a deal indeed,  
This afterlife, for you -  
You've all your former pets to feed,  
And house forever too!

'Of course, you'll need to move the ax  
Protruding from your head -  
And then there's after-passing tax,  
And rental fees,' he said.

'I'm sorry, lad,' he spoke again:  
'You did the worst you could.  
There's really nothing for it then -  

You'll have to work... *for good.*'"

He left the accursed in a sorcerous fog -  
Forever bedevilled to rhyme...  *for_your_sprog.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'North,' she smiled and sagely stated,  
Pointed forth and indicated  
All the forward land expanding:  
*'Lies whichever way you're standing!'*

'See,' she said, convinced completely,  
'When I turn,' she whispered, sweetly,  
While I waited, watched and doubted:  
'North rotates with *me!*' she shouted.

'Now it's here!' she sighed, excited;  
'Now it's here!' she cried, delighted;  
'Now it's *here!'* she spoke, elated.

'NO IT'S NOT,' I said, frustrated."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I've wondered and wandered and pondered,' I said:  
'I've queried and questioned the thoughts in my head -  
I've studied and searched for the most of my youth -  
I've parsed and perused and prospected the truth!

'I've read and reflected and reasoned for years -  
While aching and breaking and waking to tears!  
I've lived in a thunder of wonder and doubt -  
I just need an answer! I just need an out!

'So tell me,' I whispered, 'and comfort the curse!  
What *meaning* exists in the crux of the verse?  
*Explain to me, master!*' I prayed to him, primed. 
 
He thought for a moment: '... It just sort of rhymed.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy took an 'E'  
To while away the night:  
'I barely felt a *thing*,' said he,  
And spoke, 'this can't be right.'

He waited half a second's span -  
A moment more, or two -  
And when, at last, the next began,  
He wondered what to do.

'Perhaps it takes a *few* before  
It settles in,' he sighed.  
So Timmy swallowed sixty more.

And Timmy fucking died.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Before we start our lover's tryst,  
I ought to tell you, slow -

Recline, relax, and count on me -  
I'm checking down and up!

Poem_for_your_sprog,"She waited, fair, with auburn hair,  
And stared, alone, ahead -  
A glass of wine to lips divine,  
In shades of ruby red.

The music played; she softly swayed,  
And danced before the beat -  
And every shift and step and lift  
Was soft and small and sweet.

Their hands embraced; a moment chaste,  
But more than all he'd known.  
'My love,' he spoke - and then he woke,  
Alone again.  

*Alone.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"He rubbed his eyes and sadly sighed,  
Then slowly shook his head -  
'This simply mustn't stand,' he cried:  
'It can't go on,' he said.

'There's something *wrong*,' he stood to say,  
And shook with rage and doubt -  
'When *suicide's* the only way

A lawman wandered close behind,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"He rolled on old and rusted rails,  
The shade of woe and shame -  
A withered wreck of broken nails  
That dropped and fell in tarnished trails,  
As though a track of haunted tales  
Attended where he came.

His engine beat a pulse of pain;  
A somber stir of sighs -  
He pushed and pulled and sweat with strain,  
And strove to roll ahead in vain,  
Until, at last subdued, the train  
Succumbed with fearful eyes.

'It follows, boy,' he slowly spoke,  
And grieving, horror-struck -  
The engine burst and bled and broke,  
And through the shrieking, screaming smoke,  
A *man* emerged - and then I woke,  
And whispered, *'what the fuck?'* "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Hitler emerged from the door at the base,  
He stumbled with bruises and dirt on his face.  
'What *happened*, mine Führer?' said Goebbels, aghast:  
'What terribly awful occurrence has passed?'

The leader retreated with doubt in his eyes -  
He quivered and shivered and looked to the skies.  
'It's ghastly,' he whispered: 'A vision of Hell.  
I tried to ascend to the top, but *Eiffel.*'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"The *worst* advice I often hear  
Persists inside my mind -  
It's oft-repeated, year on year,  
And vaguely ill-defined:

'Tomorrow's just another day,  
And nothing's set, it seems -  
The future's bright,' and people say:  
*'Go forth, and live your dreams.'*

... *and that's okay* - of course you ought  
To chase ambition true -  
But always temper dreams with thought,  
And careful planning too.

Perhaps your passion's fashion, bro;  
Perhaps your heart's in art;  
But take a *con* for every *pro*,  
And know, before you start:

No matter what the aim or end -  
No matter what you do -  
You need to try your best, my friend,  
To make it work for *you.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I have hurried and raced,

Till they told me my rollers were gay -

*Yes they are,*  
That my fruit boots are leading the way!"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy went to pray,  
With other wayward teens -  
They proudly taught him how to play  
A game they called 'Sardines'.

'You have to hide,' explained his friend,  
And told him what to do -  
'And then we'll look, and in the end,  
We'll all be finding you!'

So Timmy chose a dusty room,  
And gaily went to hide -  
But Timmy's buddies sealed the tomb.  

And Timmy fucking died."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'You see what I'm saying?' I said with a sigh -  
'I've already done it! It's time for goodbye!

'You see,' I explained, with the flash of a smile:  
'I'm all up to date, and I'm done for a while!  
It's pointless to stay here for *nothing*, my friend -  
Why linger for longer? Why wait till the end?

'It's openly better, you have to admit:  
I won't have to sit here *pretending* and shit!  
I'll see you tomorrow, so what do you say?'

They tripled my workload and sent me away."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"They gathered round the tousled ground,

'I know it's over,' Brock began,  
And sadly shook his head:  
'But twenty years was awesome, man -  
He just got *old,*' he said.

And so he slowly turned to go,  
And left, defeated, through.  
The other placed his cap below,  
And whispered, *'Pikachu.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'So let me get this straight,' he said,  
And slowly raised his hand -  
He closed his eyes and shook his head:  
'I *think* I understand.

'I *think* you mean to turn a tap,

On grounds of 'portability',  
'Convenience' and 'ease'?

'I *think* you mean to take the stuff

And then for each demand enough  
To fund a thousand more?'

The chairman paused to think a while -    
He flashed a sleazy grin.  
He settled back, and with a smile,  
He softly said: *'We're in.'*

To stake my *reddit* claim!

'Perhaps,' he beamed, and dreamed, esteemed,  
Of freely-fawning folk -  
'My nimble wit will snugly fit  
Amongst the *best*,' he spoke.

To hike his karma-haul -  
He chanced his fate... and posted late.  
And no one saw.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I have always been religious,

I enlisted in prestigious  
Sacerdotal institutes. 

But I still recall the morning  
When it all appeared to pass -  
When the summer sun was dawning  
On the chapel after mass.

I had fastened shut the psalter,  
And I left the faith behind -  
For it faltered on the alter,  
When she blew my fucking mind."

'The moon, the *moon*, the MOON!' she cried,  
And pointed up, distraught.

At last, her panic seemed to pass -  
Her terror faded, through.  
I freed my arm, and grabbed her glass,  
And said: *'No more for you.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I have dreamt of a space  
In a faraway place,

Where the wind in the trees  
Is a strawberry breeze,  
And it blows from the moon and from Mars,  
*Yes it does,*  
And it blows from the moon and from
 Mars.

I have seen the abode  
At the end of the road,  
Where you travel by car or by ship -  
And you fly or you float  
On a glider or boat,  
On a magic, miraculous trip,  
*Yes you do,*  
On a magic, miraculous trip!

I have dreamt of its scent  
And I've settled, content,  
For a dream of a dream from before -  
For an all you can eat  
Full of waffles and meat  
Is a fantasy, friend, nothing more,   
*Yes it is,*  
It's a fantasy, friend, nothing more.

He sliced a bag and rolled a note.

You seek a finer end -

Inside a *book*, my friend.

Sojourn a spell on Middle Earth;  
A trip beyond the stars -  
A hitch, a hike, with all your worth,  
Across the Moon and Mars.

Support or seize an iron throne  
With dragon bone and smoke -  
Or face the darkness, all alone,  
With just your wand and cloak.

Patrol a path along the beams  
To test and try the fates -  
A world of rich and splendid dreams  
Beyond the wardrobe waits.

So take a step on stranger sands,  
And read and dream an age -  
And lose yourself to paper lands,  
And live amidst the page."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"*An Ode to the Worm*

*

Where the butterfly's fly,  
And the old willows weep -  
Where the sun's in the sky,  
And you dream in your sleep  
Of the faces we knew,  
And the things that we've seen,  
And the things that we do,  
And the places we've been -  

Where a song's on the breeze,  
And the Nightingale cries -  
Where the wind's in the trees,  
And the moon's on the rise  
In a sky full of stars  
That we spied up above,  
And you pointed to Mars,  
And we lay there in love -

I will wait for you there  
At the end of the end,  
And again we shall share  
In the pleasures, my friend,  
As forever we should,  
So let's do it, and quick -  
'Cause the money's so good,  
That I'm losing my dick.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy, unemployed,  
Espied a means to earn -  
They offered riches, overjoyed,   
For just a *small* return.

He pondered, mulled, and planned it out.  
He dwelled, and where he went -  
He cleared his mind of groundless doubt,  
And made his choice, content. 

'And so, *so long*,' he softly wrote -  
And when the lad was done,  
He shared a smile, and signed his note:

Consider a few little changes to start:

It's simple advice, but it's prudent, no doubt -  
Prepare your own food and avoid eating out.  
That sandwich and cookie and coffee with foam -  
It's endlessly cheaper to make it at home!

Reduce, if you're smoking, or bid them goodbye!  
Go make yourself handy and learn DIY!  
Whenever you're shopping, whatever you do -  
Just ask: *'do I need this?'* and answer it true.

Consider a budget, or system to save -  
It's easy to yield to the stuff that you crave.  
Account for your cash, and the life that you lead -  
Make lists when you're shopping and get what you need!

Remember: it's not about crafting a ploy  
To drop or deny all the things you enjoy -  
To linger, surviving on ramen and beans -

It's just about living inside of your means.

A Peter; a Percy; a piston or pork -  
A snake and a schlong and a schnitzel and sub -  
A wang, or a wong, or a wiener to rub -

A heat-seeking hammer; a hose with a head -  
A fleshy wee fella, depravity-fed -  
A penis; a pecker; a private; a prick -  
The deepest of divers; a dagger; a dick -

A bedtime banana; a trouser surprise -  
An underwear serpent with *bollocks* for eyes -  
However you whack it, attack it, or wank -  
Hawaii awaits in the splooge of your spank!

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'IMAGINE THAT!' he said and sighed:  
'Instead of *justice* served,' he cried,  
'They'd simply stand and shoot on sight  
In disregard of what was right,  
And what was wrong, and what was fair,  
And what was *good*, without a care  
For what was just, or what was due,  
And what was true and lawful too!  
And *if* they shot some kid to death,  
Or held him down until his breath  
Was pained and strained and drained and passed  
A fateful final time at last  
For nothing great or grave at all,  
We wouldn't let the fuckers fall,  
We'd simply sling them out a day,  
Deny the facts, suspend with pay!  
*Imagine* how the world would be  
If THAT was true?' he said to me.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"On cold and silent city streets  
In cars of crimson red,  
An engine whirs to life and beats  
A beat to stir the dead.

They wake with curtains twitched aside,  
And try to hide, afraid -  
A gleaming rose and silver ride  
Arises through the shade. 

Their children shift in sleep and dream  
A dream of dread and dark -  
Of amber flame; the creaking scream  
Of blistered wood and spark.

And so the wheels begin to turn.  
The shadows drift apart.  
The night ignites.  
Infernos burn.  

And sirens, somewhere, start.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Once upon a midnight peeping,  
While my parents slumbered, sleeping,  
There I palmed a passion, keeping  
Soft and silent too -  

There I sat and captivated,  
Dearly watched, and willful, waited,  
Shallow-breathed with brisk and bated  
Breaths I swiftly drew -

There I stared as steamy motions  
Planted nice and naughty notions;  
Sudden swelling deep devotions,  
Sown and grown anew -

There was she - a maiden's measure,  
Struck with thrusts and turns of pleasure;  
Sordid, saucy teenage treasure,  
Left for me to view -  

There was I, with pleasure peaking -  
There was she, in rapture, shrieking -  
There was... *he*, up-close and speaking. 

Still - I saw it through.

Beyond your double-action snout;  
Your sloppy-snotty-sneezing spout.

Perhaps today, at last -  
But time is quick to slip away,  
And chances swiftly passed.

There's always more for you and yours,  
You hope inside your heart -  
But life's bizarre, and closes doors,  
Before you've time to start.  

So take the time to make it right,  
And know, for what it's worth -  
Perhaps you'll raise a spark of light,  
On someone's lonely Earth."

They went at it weakly, and wiggled and wormed.  
They clumsily bumped and they bucked and they moaned -  
They grinded and whined and they grumbled and groaned.

They wilted and withered. They waned in the heat.  
They lustlessly, listlessly, thrust with defeat.  
They shuffled and scuffled, and broke for a breath -  
They woefully whimpered and whispered of meth.

They tumbled together with sadness and strain -  
Obsession, depression, discomfort and pain -  
Affliction, addiction, and sorrow to see.

I said he'd never made a friend;

His lost and loveless life would end;  
He'd gained a heap of weight.   

I said he'd mastered pointless pride,

The folks that pass me by -  
A busy street; a moving car;  
A stranger's chancing eye.

*I wonder what they think of worth,*  
*And if they're how they seem -*  
*The thoughts that fill their lonely Earth -*  
*The dreams they dare to dream.*

I wonder if they're *really* who   
They always hoped to be.  
I wonder if they wonder too -  
And think the same of me."

*'Oh sages of silence; oh funeral fates:*  
*I work for your pleasure! Your servant awaits!*  
*Imbue me with knowledge, and help me to know -*  
*Command me, oh spirits of wisdom and woe!'*

And then, with a shudder and shake of his head,  
He stared at the potion to see what it said.  
*'How is it?'* his client had mumbled and moaned -  
He rose from the darkness, and whispered: '... you're boned.'

It's in the waste of night.

It's in the silence stowed away  
Behind an open door.  
It's in the dark, and in the day,  
And in the rest, and more.

It's in the things you think you see.  
The old familiar fear.  
A shadow's standing over me.  

It helps to know you're here."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"She watched it curve and swoop and swerve -  
It looped the lumpy land!  
It turned and twirled and whipped and whirled,

*It hurried forth, and hurdled north,*

'They tell me what I *want*,' he cried,  
'And what I surely won't -  
I think it's so unfair,' he sighed.

I whispered: 'no you don't.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Remember how we used to smile  
To share a foolish thought?  
To simply wait and walk a while?  
To talk of all, and nought?

*We'd spend our days and nights as two,*  
*Content to stare above.*  
*I always felt the same with you -*  
*It seemed a sort of love.*

And so we made it something more -  
But something came to end.  
We never found what came before.

I miss my finest friend. "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I pondered excuses to form a reply,  
In search of a reason, or logical lie:  
*I'm working*; *I'm busy*; *I'm saving*; *I'm sick*;  
*I'm writing some music to play on a dick!*

*But no, that's psychotic. Perhaps I'm in pain?*  
*Affected by air, and allergic to rain?*  
*I'm waiting for parcels? I'm curling my hair?*  
*I'm shaving the cat, and I've nothing to wear!?*

'So what do you reckon?' he thought to express,  
Diverting my thoughts from internal distress.  
'I'm sort of...,' I started, 'I'm just a... you know?  
It's really... but kind of... I don't want to go.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Simply, softly, smoothly sliding,

Nor leave your kids with broken hearts  
And broken dreams one hopeless night.  
You aren't your dad. 

You'll do it right.

A second's stony spell.

*A world of wonder lost in script,*  
*And scrolls that curled to ash.*

He watched the waste of wiser days;  
The fall of thought and mind -

You see, inside this picked and chosen thread,  
A little honest word's the thing, it seems -    
The only *truth* that's underneath your bed  
Is dust and crusty socks and broken dreams.

Imagine all you wish, my wretched friend;  
Just close your eyes and try - *I understand.*  
I'm sure it's hard to live when in the end,  
The only love you know's your questing hand.

*Alas, my friend, I'm sadly out of time.*  
*I'm off to work - but loved the chance to rhyme.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"You needn't spend your nights in lonely doubt  
(Although I'm sure you've little option more) -  
Be bold, my wayward friend, and ask her out!  
At worst, she'll laugh, like all the girls before.

When next you've spent your swift but nightly task;  
When next you've filled the box beneath your bed;  
Retrieve your best fedora, friend, and ask -  
Or plan for further lonely nights ahead.

If mother spurns your nice but wordy plea,  
Or notes, perhaps, the social airs you lack -  
Your brother's always willing, waiting free.  
I somewhere heard he sleeps upon his back.

*At least you'll interact with someone new.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Or so you *say*, my timely rhyming friend -  
I doubt she'd stand to swear the same, in truth.  
Perhaps she seeks a more contented end;  
A salve for years she spent on *you* in youth.

What kind of man, to find himself apart,  
Should in the slight of others seek delight?  
Is this the cause behind your caustic heart,  
And why, perhaps, you lie alone at night?

Your brother sleeps a slumber sweet again -  
The peaceful dreams of steady, hushed relief;  
They lie beyond the grasp of meaner men -  
Of those who'd rather woes, than shed their grief.

*But still, my friend - there's time for comfort yet:*  
*To learn to love and live, forgive, forget.*"

I'm sure,' he sadly sighed -  
'I'd like to buy a butterfly

He smiled and softly spoke -  
'To see them soar and move and more  
Like tiny floating folk.

'A fancy few of red and blue  
To shelter, save, and show.  
A simple scheme - a simple dream,  
But sort of nice, you know?'

'So long,' he said, and shook his head,  
Then shook his *head*: 'farewell.'  
The other, free, began to pee,  
And whispered: '... what the hell?'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Come gather, ye children - ye darlings of youth;  
I'll spin you a story of passion and truth!

He told them his story, and wistfully smiled:

That day in the pool that I'll never forget.'

I don't need a note, or a text from her phone.

(You've clicked on a thread and you've swallowed the bait) -

*Remember when browsing, in all that you do:*  
*You're talking to people - to people like you.*  
*Consider perspectives before you embark -*  
*And read what you're rating before you remark!*  

Remember that voting's a valuable force

Don't criticise blindly, or silence with glee -  
And don't simply upvote because you agree!

*Remember, that whether you're wrong or you're right -*  
*There's never a need for unkindness or spite.*  
*Behave with good will, and good grace, and good sense -*  
*And know that a moron delights in offence.*

For actions, distractions, attractions, and more! 
 
Have *fun* while you do it - go forth and explore!"

While all the thoughts within you vie,  
And fight for room inside -  

*If you can stand, with courage found,*  
*Or boldly step with grace -*  
*To bravely show the world you're bound,*  
*And poised to find your place -* 

If you can fake to make it true,  
Or further, friend, by far -  
You'll find, inside, the *other* you. 

The *you* you really are."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Whenever you're bashful; whenever you're blue -  
Embarrassed and awkward and angry with you -  
Whenever you're feeling unlovely, alone -  
A loveliness waits, and it's all of your own.

*Whenever you're down, and whenever you're out -*  
*In sadness, in sorrow, in darkness, in doubt -*  
*Remember: if you have the will for a while -*  
*There's fountains of charm to be found in a smile.*

*To stand with eyes of steel:*  
*'There ain't a beast from west to east*

Sat beside his silent station,

Pasty, vainly braced -

*There he watched it winding, waiting,*  
*Turning, twisting, twirled, rotating -*  
*Wilted, withered will abating,*  
*Bold resolve misplaced.*

Questing, testing fingers raided.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young, and softly shy,  
Or apt to brood and think -  
I found a braver, bolder guy  
Inside a glass of drink.

I drank -  
And drank -  
And *drank*, and found  
Without a drink or three -  
I wasn't *fun* to be around;  
I wasn't *really* me.

And so I slipped from self-control,  
And drank my doubts away -  
I'll whisper *yes* and pay the toll,  
When *no*'s so hard to say."

And tenderly whispered: 'Stop breathing, my love.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'*So how's the search?*'... and thus began  
The formless flow of thought.  
The endless, timeless, ceaseless span  
That held me captured, caught.

*My wasted wits were worn upon*  
*A slow subconscious rift -*  
*And as her voice continued on,*  
*My soul began to drift.*

I weighed the place beyond the black;  
The sounds inside a breath -  
The path to inner-space and back;  
The doubts of life and death.

*Her oft-repeated mouthing made*  
*A beat within my mind -*  
*A song of silence, slowly played;*  
*An endless vision, blind.*

And then, at last, it passed and died;  
I sighed and broke the spell -  
I shook my head and so replied:  

'Oh Helen... Go to hell.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I think,' she exclaimed with a wink of an eye,  
'It's endlessly better incredibly high!  
It's finer the further you flee from the floor -  
I'll saddle you up and I'll ride you to war!

*For soaring, exploring, a chivalrous steed!*  
*For carefully climbing; to slip and to stand -*  
*For watching a concert and seeing the band!*  

'Or maybe,' she giggled, 'I'll reach any shelf -  
If you'll be my giant, then I'll be your elf!  
We'll quest and we'll jaunt and we'll journey afar!  
But first,' she suggested... 'a drink at the bar?'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Little Timmy went to tea  
At Granny’s birthday brunch,  
He spied with growing greedy glee  
The mounds of food to munch.

*He piled his plate with meats and treats,*  
*And jellies, juice, and jams –*  
*With salty snacks and sugared sweets,*  
*And giant heaps of hams!*

*'Bon Appetit!'* his granny said,  
And grinned her granny's grin:  
'I baked a hundred loaves of bread,  
I hate to see you thin!'

*So Timmy scoffed a plate or three,*  
*And granny slowly sighed:*  
*'Now come and get a taste of me.'*  

*And Timmy fucking died.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"If, perhaps, you've entered, eager,  
Wayward learning minor-leaguer,  
Contemplate your musings meagre,  
While you read below:

*Small delays in simple stages*  
*Stretch to useless, fruitless ages!*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Twas late one autumn eventide,  
When gleaming, beaming bright -  
A light emerged from close beside,  
And shooed away the night.

*I read with blurred and bleary eyes*  
*The glossy text displayed -*  
*Then lurched awake with shocked surprise*  
*To see the words it made.*

My breath was quick. My tongue was dry.  
My heart was beating fast.  
I paused and penned my swift reply:  
'Thank god,' I wrote - *'at last!'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He sat at the table with spellbinding eyes -  
His laugh was a breeze through the sweet summer skies;  
His voice was a sigh from the starlight above -  
I knew we were perfect.  
I knew it was love.

*We parted, intended forever, I knew.*  
*His message arrived as I readied for bed.*  
*I looked at it, breathless.* 

*'No worries,' I said.*

A place to play ahead -

*And fret distressed, dismayed -*  
*And soon the boy was feeling weak,*  
*And found himself afraid.*

He shook his head, for all was well,  
And climbed the nearest pine.  
But Little Timmy slipped and fell.

And Timmy's fucking *fine*."

That's right. You settle in.

*The need for... Oh. I see.*  
*Perhaps Louise would be so good*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I still recall the day she broke;  
The awful, empty stare -

The sight of dark despair.

*The shade of loss and grief -*  
*She whispered words in quiet cries*  
*Of mourning disbelief.*

The light inside began to fade,  
But on she read, and on.  
'What is it, dear?' I asked, afraid.  
'It's *Sears*,' she said.

'It's gone.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*Love*, I always thought was fleeting,  
Fading, flawed, and fast-retreating,  
Seldom set in stone or meeting  
All I once believed –

*Love*, I often stopped to wonder,  
Leaves on weaving waves of thunder,  
Tearing dreams of joy asunder,  
Bitter, blue, bereaved –

*Love* was stories; love was fiction;  
Love was notes of contradiction,  
Fit for myths and false depiction,  
Never *once* achieved –

*Love* was draining, frenzied, frantic,  
Spurious and sycophantic...  
Till I saw the most *bromantic*  
Ageless love conceived.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"In spirals of silence; in absence of light;  
In cover of darkness and canvas of night;  
In smoke and seclusion; in shelter and shade -  
It slips through the umbra, and under, afraid.

*Where particles gather; where shadow-shapes shift;*  
*Where thoughts are forgotten, abandoned, adrift;*  
*Where fraction's the risk, and surrender, the cost -*  
*It fights for the fallen, and looks for the lost.*

And when it has fought under faraway skies,  
To capture its conquest and plunder the prize;  
It crosses dimensions, to send and to share -  
For unity, love... and for socks in a pair."

Joe had no friend.  
Joe's days were long at either end.

An anal salute for a toot that you've planned!

Soundless as the dead -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"*What Makes Me Feel Old*

*

So.  
You know when you're stressed,  
And you wake up reeling  
With that feeling in your chest,  
Stealing your breath?  
Well when I was a kid  
It seemed like everything I did  
Left me scared to death,  
Or drowned in doubt  
And cast about,  
Till I'd *fixed* it in my head  
And figured it out.

I used to lie in bed,  
Prostrate and scared,  
Afraid I'd made some *huge* mistake,  
Or spoken words that proved me fake,  
Or broken rules too big to break,  
Before I'd even marched a step  
Beyond the school-yard gate.

I used to wait,  
Content to lie,  
And question who, and when, and why,  
And *where* was I?  
And did I fit?  
And could I stand a life of it,  
Or was it just too late?

And so I woke  
And wished each day  
To grow so fast  
That all the past,  
Would simply pass away.

But the problem is -  
*It did.*

See when I was a kid,  
What I wanted was truth,  
And the wisdom to cope with my fears.    
But all that arrived was a longing for youth,  
And the feeling I'd wasted my years.

*

TL,DR:

To say it quicker once again:  

My friends, if truth be told -  
I'm past the point of saving then,  
If twenty-one is *old*!

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Sorry for the delay in answering this next one. Been typing out this behemoth of a response -

*

&gt;What advice would you give to a hobbyist poet who wants to be more engaged in a community/have some audience for their work?

*

There's little fortune found in rhyme,  
And so I'll tell you true:  
Enjoy the art, and take your time,  
And mostly - *write for you.*

*

What I mean is – enjoy yourself writing, and don't worry too much about what other people think.

As for advice: I'm probably the worst person to ask for tips on writing (seeing as I barely know what I'm doing...), but I'm happy to try! If you don't mind, I'll also use this response to offer some more general advice too, seeing as there are a lot of questions below asking for the same.

First things first, I'll show you what *I* do. Obviously, any advice is dependent on the style you're trying to go for, but if it's to produce something similar in structure to one of mine, hopefully the below will be of (*some*) use to you:

1. I try not to rhyme. No, wait - that's not quite right. Let's try again:  
1. Revised #1: I try not to *try* to rhyme (... that's a little better.) Let me explain: I really like rhyme. That's probably pretty obvious, but I love the way it sounds read aloud. It boggles my mind that eight little syllables of text on a white page can have a wonderful rhythm that a capable author can naturally imbue simply by selecting the right words. That's what I try to do - and often fail. The thing is, really *trying* to rhyme is a killer - both for enthusiasm, and for the poem itself. Forced rhymes sound... well... forced.  
I guess what I'm clumsily trying to say here is that it's best to practice loads until the rhymes come easily - until that sense of rhythm that leads into the right sound at the end of a good line is a natural thing.

2. Read! Some of my favourite poets are Roald Dahl, Spike Milligan, and Shel Silverstein. I love the silly, playful sense of rhyme those guys (all gone now, unfortunately) were capable of coming up with. Children's rhyme, in fact, but with a meaning that was often far more dark or adult, or just funny on a level that you didn't quite get as a kid. If I could write half-an-ounce as well as any one of them, I'd be a happy novice.  
Thing is - these guys are quite good to start with, even if their poems aren't really your thing. They all tend to write within certain rhyming schemes and structures, so they're a good place to look for a sense of rhythm and metre.

3. As a general tip, I pretty much consistently start at the end. This isn't always true, of course, but I do always know where the poem's headed. The difficult part (or sometimes *easy* part, depending on the mood you're in) is in getting there, but remember that the journey is as important as the destination. On that note, I don't consciously pick a metre either, but wait to see how the first couple of lines come out. That pretty much decides it for me.

4. Read it aloud! I've never clicked on the 'save' tab on reddit without reading whatever I've written out loud first (and at least a dozen times). I truly believe that all poetry is meant for hearing like a good story, and it's only when you actually say the words that you can get a sense of how it actually sounds. That's obviously even more true when you're dealing with rhyme - it's pretty much *all* about how it sounds. Writing in iambs or whatever, you're only really gonna get a sense of how the stresses work - that is, if they're actually in the right place or not - by reading it aloud.

*

Reading back through that now, it occurs that there's actually quite a lot of crap surrounding a few very easy pointers - practice, read, write with purpose, and read again (aloud). If that's remotely useful to you, then fantastic. If not - sorry.

Lastly - if ever you need a willing reader and a critical eye, feel free to send me something you write! That offer extends to everyone.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Thanks so much for the kind words - I'm pleased as hell that you and your brothers have enjoyed the rhymes. What a fantastic compliment to hear that you all read them! Thanks again.

That's a good question. To be brutally honest, I live a pretty privileged life - I have a roof over my head, I have a job, and I have a loving, supportive family. Some of the darker and more sombre poems that I've written deal with topics that I have never, thankfully, had to contend with in the real world.

Because of this, I think that an author's level of accomplishment often lies in their capacity for empathy. It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who has experienced something that you haven't, but being able to *understand* their experience (or try to at least) is an invaluable skill.

I do my best to capture the mood and feeling of a thread and comment - on the occasions where the poem makes it feel like the original commenter is the one that's writing or expanding on their experiences (or the 'feel' their comment's created), I've succeeded."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;How long does it take you to write a Reddit-poem?

Though rather dependent on topic and time -  
On mood and on metre; on rhythm and rhyme -  
A normal reply on a thread of a night  
Takes minutes to plan, and a moment to write!

*If funny or foolish; if silly or sweet -*  
*Then these are the quickest there are to complete.*  
*If sad or if serious, bitter, or blue -*  
*I'd rather I paused for a moment or two.*

A song for a sadness? An ode for an ex?  
The choices are harder; the challenge, complex.  
What word do you favour? What concept alone  
Can resonate right to the reader unknown?  

*And so I'll repeat for an effortless end -*  
*The time is dependent on everything, friend.*  
*But still - till the line at the end from the start...*  
*I write them with joy, and with thanks in my heart.*

*

The timing really does depend on a lot - the comment I'm responding to, the structure I've chosen to write in, and the 'theme' of the rhyme. Most of my comments take about 10-20 minutes or so, but some of the more [serious, lengthier poems](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yc020/what_is_a_personal_flaw_that_you_can_openly_admit/cp862xx?context=3) take quite a bit longer - and some of the [silly short ones](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/35tpuk/what_jobs_attract_the_biggest_assholes/cr7urra?context=3) take no time at all!

&gt;How do you decide which comments 'deserve' a poem?

I don't know if I can accurately explain this, but I'll try anyway: something just sort of feels 'right' when you find the right comment. It's as though it's a square hole, and you know you've got the right square peg to fit - all you need to do is figure out the angle to make it work.

Admittedly, that sounds a little more suggestive than originally intended."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I'm a postgraduate student and teacher - the classes I teach (not poetry-related, alas!) have ended for this academic year now, and I've just handed in my thesis. At the moment, I'm working retail more or less full-time until my final examinations in a few months.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;Did you start with a ""regular"" reddit account before you decided to go with your novelty one?

I did, but not for long!

&gt;What inspired you to turn comments into poems?

I've asked myself the same question a number of times. I'll let the rhyme explain:

*

Once upon a misty morning,  
Seeing sunrise drifting, dawning,  
Woke a certain creature, yawning,  
Jaded, dropped, and drained.

So it rose, with feathers ruffled -   
Deep from sleep it slowly shuffled -  
Zest for life and living muffled,  
Feelings fixed and feigned.

*So it rose* – and felt occurring  
Something strange, and stranger stirring –  
Thoughts were whizzing; works were whirring,  
Spurring unrestrained!

*So it rose* – and to its wonder,  
Something *fun* had drifted under,  
Blowing all its blues asunder,  
Swiftly entertained!

Thus arrived the rhyming crafter -  
How it loved the joy and laughter -  
*So it rose* - and ever after,  
Still the joy remained.

*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Thanks so much for your comment, kiwisurf. It's hard to express this via text, but it's really humbling to read that something I've written on reddit has helped you in the real world in some small way.

I've written quite a lot on depression over the last few years - as a consequence, I've had a lot of personal messages from people suffering from anxiety-related problems on a day-to-day basis. Though it's really pleasing to read that a rhyme's connected with a person, it's absolutely tragic that a rhyme on a subject matter like depression can connect with *so many*.

It's such an awful shame that mental health issues are so misunderstood and stigmatised in our allegedly progressive societies - but I think that it *is* getting better over time."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Haha! This is wonderful. For whatever reason, this question has followed me around for quite some time. Despite what some people have said (I read every comment), I've never explicitly commented on it myself.

Okay - to answer in the only way I know how:

*

A poet's pen upon a page –  
Whatever form it fills -  
It has no gender, race, nor age,  
But what the writer wills.

*A verse of lines from end to end,*  
*Of any fine amount –*  
*The author's self is moot, my friend –*  
*The words are all that count.*  

So cast your findings far away –    
The rhyme's the same, you see.  
In any case, I'll smile and say:  

'Dear reddit, I'm a... *me*!'

*

Okay though - if you *reeeaaally* want to know... I am, in fact, a [male](#s)

Or am I?

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"That's a really good question! I've answered one above on my favourite poems from others, but it's surprisingly difficult to pick one of my own. There are a few that, for one reason or another, are quite close to my heart. I'll just mention 2 here, for the sake of time:

[This one on OCD](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/29qfnm/what_common_misconceptions_really_irk_you/cinik24?context=3) is probably the one that I see most linked to on reddit - it seems to be the one that resonates with a lot of people, and I've received a lot of mostly-positive messages about it. I think it works because there's just a very sudden change in tone - and it suits the gravity of the theme.

[This rhyme on Terry Pratchett's death](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ysvzb/terry_pratchett_has_died_megathread/cpcp6bg?context=3) is *probably* my favourite. I was (and still am) [a huge Pratchett fan](http://imgur.com/a/VwOKt), and his death came as a genuine loss to me. It was nice and cathartic to write something, and it all came out in a very quick rush.

To turn this question around though: which of them do you like best? I'd love to know :)"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There are lots of times when I've written a rhyme and then decided not to post it - but it's actually because I'm just not happy with the way it turned out, more often that not. I'm quite critical of my own stuff - if you look through my user page, you're sure to see a familiar little edit asterisk alongside a fair few comments! 

I can't help but toy with them sometimes. If there's anything that just sort of sounds *off* in some way, I'll keep at it until it's fixed (until I *think* it's fixed, that is), or until I delete the rhyme in frustration!

There *are* occasions where I've been a little worried about what reddit might think of a rhyme - I tend to start those poems, get about half-way through, and then suddenly reconsider posting..."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;How did you get started with reddit?

A friend introduced me. Had I known beforehand how much time I would eventually spend here, I might have sucker-punched him before he did.

&gt;Favorite poem? 

I'm gonna choose the very lazy way out here and pick a whole load of my favourite poems, so that I don't have to pick the best. I read a lot of different authors nowadays, but there are certain poems that have stuck with me - and will continue to do so, I'm sure - for life. I love Shel Silverstein's [Where the Sidewalk Ends](http://i.imgur.com/UlI7EPY.jpg), Roald Dahl's story-poems, such as [The Three Little Pigs](http://allpoetry.com/The-Three-Little-Pigs), and anything by Spike Milligan and Edward Gorey. Of course, then there's [The Raven](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178713) by Edgar Allen Poe, [If](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/175772) by Rudyard Kipling, and pretty much anything by Dylan Thomas. 

I'm sorry - I totally failed at picking a favourite.

&gt;How many centuries of gold do you have?

A sonnet for you:

Upon a gaudy throne of gilded leaf;  
A royal seat of richest ruby-red;  
Within a world of wealth beyond belief -  
A man named Midas sighed and shook his head.

*Beneath a mountain made in middle-Earth;*  
*Before the finest treasures there possessed;*  
*Surrounded by the boundless fount of worth -*  
*A dragon woke and glanced around, depressed.*  

The royal sulked and sadly shivered cold;  
The dragon roared a flash of fire and fog;  
And each bemoaned their cherished stores of gold –  

For not a one had half as much as [Sprog](http://i.imgur.com/60gwarY.png).

(But all the same, across the sands of time –  
The banks, alas, don’t care for gilded rhyme!)

Thanks for the questions!
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I know in times of stress and strife  
When pleasant presents end -  
Alas, there isn't much in life  
On which I might depend.

*The lifting, shifting, drifting state*  
*Across the changing Earth -*  
*The boundless forms of fitful fate*  
*Of cryptic weight and worth -*  

And yet, despite the woes of youth;  
The queries, qualms, and more;  
There holds a lone eternal truth -  

That OP's mom's a whore."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"My father stretches every day,  
And almost every night -  
'I tell you, boy,' I heard him say,  
'A stretch can keep the clouds at bay  
The most amazing perfect way!'  
He said, with such delight.

*'And when, perhaps, your race is run,'*  
*My father sagely shared:*  
*'Or when the end's at last begun -*  
*Or when the world decides you're done -*  
*Or when it fucks your ass for fun...*  

*At least you're well prepared.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Darling dear?' she pondered, weary,  
Vision clouded, blurred and bleary:  
'While I *love* your latest theory,  
Something's off,' she said -

*'Though I'm charmed and tickled trying*  
*Poultry poorly-plucked, or frying*  
*Slightly-cooked,' she whispered, sighing,*  
*'Swiftly-steamed instead -*
 
All the same, it's rather draining;  
Putrid, puke-inducing, paining;  
Plus - *of course, I'm not complaining* -  

Both the kids are dead.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When days are hard, and nights are long;  
When storms are raging rough –  
When all my dreams are non-too-strong,  
And hopes aren't hope enough –

*I close my eyes to hear the breeze;*  
*The secret words inside –*  
*The whispered winds that shake the trees;*  
*The songs that skip and hide –*

I hear the rhymes that ride the tide;  
The swing, the sound, the beat –  
The lines that swell and slip and slide  
In stanzas, small and sweet.

*I hear the sounds that hold and wait*  
*For those who seek to find –*  
*A safer shore; a surer state;*  
*A better frame of mind.*

When days are hard; when tempests cry  
A squall of aches and pains;  
I close my eyes, and breathe a sigh –  

And poetry remains."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'If *now* is now, and *then* is then,  
And *then* was *now* before -  
Why can't it just be *then* again,  
Or *now* for moments more?

I miss the *then* - the *now* that was -  
The *then*, that is, of now -  
And want the *now* that was because  
It passed too fast, and how!

So take your *then* and think again,  
And now your *thens* will be -  
For then your *now*'s a *then* and then  
Your *then*'s a *now*, you see?' 

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I woke in the future and rose with a sigh –  
The sun shone a beam through a shuttle-filled sky –  
'Good morrow!' he called, as he worked his machine:  
'You've made it through stasis - it's *thirty-fifteen!*

*'We've mastered biotics,' he cried with a grin:*  
*'And math and mechanics and wisdoms within!*  
*We've beaten diseases (as much as we can) –*  
*We've cures for the aches and the ailments of man!*

'We've knowledge in notions you can't comprehend –  
What say you, my formerly time-frozen friend?'  
I pondered my query, and questioned him so:  
'Are printers perfected?'

He answered me: '... no.'
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'All right,' she said, then sighed instead:  
'It's time to make a start.'  
She frowned to see the face ahead -  
Her mirror counterpart.

*A minor flaw's a foolish bore,*  
*But all the same, for pride -*  
*'It's just a case of making more*  
*From what you've got,' she sighed.*

And when she'd made her choice to trade;  
To shape her own instead -  
That former flaw began to fade:  
'That's better now,' she said.

*She turned away to face the day -*  
*A friend was passing by.*  
*'What up?' he smiled, then paused to say:*  

*'Your 'brows are kinda high.'* "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He rubbed his eyes and shook his head:  
'My unsuspecting wife -  
A masturbating clown,' he said,  
'I think she's scarred for life.

*You should have seen the kids!' he cried,*  
*And shivered, cold and quick -*  
*'A grim surprise', he sadly sighed.*  

*I whispered: 'lucky prick.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I scattered rose of crimson red  
Across the dusky room -  
'*A blushing bud*,' I boldly said;  
'*A blossom's bid to bloom.*'

*And so I laughed with deep delight,*  
*And finished, roused and thrilled -*  
*The candlelight was warm and bright;*  
*The wine, uncorked and chilled.*  

I whispered wistful: 'don't forget -  
Tonight's the night to share.  
And dearest sweet, the scene is set.'

She said: 'I won't be there.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Here I stay in silence, hiding,  
Slowly planning, boldly-biding,  
Wary, watchful, guarding, guiding  
All from pain and plight.  

*Here I lie with every feature*  
*Masked within a phoney creature -*  
*I, the wise and waiting teacher,*  
*Leading, out of sight -*

... something strange is changing greatly -  
All I do is sit sedately.  
No one's come to feed me lately.  

Master loves me, right?"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I shan't forget that former time;  
That fated, dated day -  
When mother smiled and sighed, sublime,  
And sat me down to say:

*'Oh wildest child of wayward mind -*  
*Oh tiny troubled teen -*  
*How sweet to know I'll never find*  
*A 'manly' magazine -*

If I should dust this dusky room,  
Or sort its sordid state -  
Beneath the grimy under-gloom,  
No 'glossy' women wait -

*Those trying times have changed, and yet -*  
*I'll say, before we're done:*  
*Remember, boy... we share the 'net.*  

*Delete your searches, son.'*"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Perhaps it's a foolish or fanciful claim,  
But no other pain is precisely the same.  
I speak from acquaintance, and say that it's true -  
You don't really know what it means till you do.

*It's bitter and brutal, and cruelly unfair -*  
*The harshest of truths, and the hardest to bear;*  
*For there, at the end, with your pieces of heart -*  

*Your lives carry on, but you live them apart.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Dear Ted, 

I know you're not to blame.  
It's just a broken heart.  
But still, my darling -  
All the same -  
I wish we weren't apart.

*You'll say it's down to me.*

I've got no time to spare!

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;Try doing that with a big junk and you're likely to end up choking the poor person to death. Then, you end up in jail, where your oversized johnson actually can come in handy, especially you need to strangle your cellmate because his snoring is keeping you up at night.

There he sat in contemplation,  
Tasked to judge the accusation:  
'What on *earth's* your explanation?  
Come now - make it quick!'

*'Well your honour,' I related,*  
*While the judge and jury waited -*  
*Just a sad and failure-fated,*  
*Hapless country hick -*

'Though I know my crime's appalling,'  
So I spoke in sorrow, stalling,  
'Gross and grim, and gruesome, galling -  
Sombre, shocking, sick -

*'If, perhaps, you'd heard him snoring -*  
*Sneezer-screaming, sniffer-roaring -*  
*You'd agree!' I cried, imploring.*  

*'Had to choke on dick.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He sat there in silence, alarmed and afraid -  
No statement he uttered. No movement he made.  
His face was a picture of panic and dread -  
'Good heavens,' I whispered: 'what is it?' I said.

*'Old buddy,' he answered, and sobbed with a sigh:*  
*'They found inflammation - a flaw in the eye.*  
*My optics are failing; my vision's declined.*  
*I've twenty-four hours, and then I'll be blind!*

'It's certain,' he said with a sad little smile:  
'But never you worry, I've still got a while.  
I'll *read* what I can, till it's broken and blurred.'  
He looked at me, frightened. I comforted: '*NERD!*'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Upon a road in County Cork,  
One fair, delightful day -  
The folks of Ireland reached a fork,  
And chose a finer way - 

*Through Dublin, Louth, and Carlow Town -*  
*Upon the Galway quay -*  
*Through Mayo, Meath, around and down,*  
*And up the Irish Sea -*
  
They gathered by the polling post,  
And looked ahead, above -  
And made a choice, from coast to coast,  
To vote, as one, for love.

:)"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There they waited, calm, contented,  
Fortunes barely touched and dented -  
Folks that richly represented  
All of Earth's elite -  

*There they sat, serenely-knowing*  
*Just as long as funds were flowing -*  
*Riches rising, profits growing -*  
*All was safe and sweet.* 

There they watched their margins creeping,  
Moving cash for safer-keeping...  
As the gas came slowly seeping  
Through the dark, discreet."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"A tremor shook the tallest trees,  
And trembled through the ground -  
A rolling rhythm rode the breeze  
On weighted waves of sound.

*They stepped along in wretched woe;*  
*A haunted, human tide -*  
*They shuffled, staggered, swaying slow,*  
*Or falling still beside.*

They pushed and paced and ran and raced.  
They darted, dragged and dropped.  
They twist and turned and caught and chased,  
And then... 

The music stopped."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"They waved it off with banners bright,  
In candle-light aglow -  
And through the sweeping silent night,  
It rose in rapid, fleeting flight  
Beyond the happy, hopeful sight  
Of those who stood below.

*It skippered, skimmed, and hurried high,*  
*And when its juice was drained -*  
*It floated free, to drift and fly*  
*Beside the stars and shining sky -*  
*To meet the moon, and pass it by,*  
*While planet Earth remained.*

The turning time at last arrived!  
It hurried homeward, where -  
The world was dark. Deceased. Deprived.  
And nothing grew, and nothing thrived.  
And not a single soul survived.  

Poor little metal square."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I see their slender shapes at night -  
Their curved and curling frames -  
Their falling forms in velvet-white,  
And rose of crimson flames -  

*I hear their silent sweet retreat -*  
*Their final caving cry -*  
*Their shock and awe to meet defeat*  
*Before my waiting eye -*

The time is come. My turn begins.  
I take the chance again!  
I thrust and twist, then count the pins!  

There's always fucking ten."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"She spoke her slogan, well-rehearsed,  
And oftentimes expressed:  
'If you can't take me at my worst,  
You don't *deserve* my best!

*So there!' she grinned, content with glee,*  
*And pompous, proud delight -*  
*Emboldened by banality,*  
*And self-important trite.*

'All-right,' I said - 'I'm gone, and glad.'  
She turned with dark dismay.  
'You see - your worst is *really* bad.  
Your best is just okay.'"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"No matter where I lay my frame to rest -  
No matter how I find my sweet release -  
I know to lightly lay it where it's best -  
That peerless place of pure and perfect peace -

*The worldly, wise, and wary wish to wait -*  
*To stall inside a stall and sort the scene -*  
*To scrutinise the stage and see it straight -*  
*To stay, or search for sweeter sights, serene -*  

So if it is I turn my *other* cheek -  
To sit and muse on wonder, wit, and whim -  
In doing so, forever do I seek...  
That magic space betwixt the seat and rim."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"To those who sit and sadly sigh:  
'Our finest days have gone -  
The best of times have passed us by,   
And passing, travelled on.'

*To those who mope and moan for more:*  
*'It's not the same, you see?*  
*I miss the way it was before,*  
*And how it used to be.'*  

To those, my friend, I say: *at last!*  
How fine, and fair, and right.  
I'm often pleased the past has passed. 
 
The future's looking bright.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Shadow-silent, slowly-easing  
Through the shade to see them squeezing,  
Groping, pleasing, touching, teasing,  
Rapt with dark delight –

*There was I in wordless wonder,*  
*Proud to find my peeping-plunder,*  
*Cloaked and quiet, covered under*  
*Shrouded shade of night.*

So it was I watched delighted,  
Captivated uninvited,  
Till a voice beside, excited,  
Whispered: '*awesome, right?!*'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Remember when the sun was bright,  
And shone upon the shore -  
And every dawn was sweet and right,  
And full of faith and more?

*Remember when the summers seemed*  
*To last an age and stay -*  
*And every hope and dream you dreamed*  
*Was but a chance away?*

Remember when you loved to wake,  
And all the skies were blue -  
And every shot was yours to take,  
And every day was new?

*Remember all the bygone bliss?*  
*Remember when, my friend?*  
*Remember that? Remember this -*  

*It doesn't have to end.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"In early, primal, ancient days,  
Before the final freeze,  
Emerged a mass of waifs and strays  
From out the salty seas.

*They crawled beyond the savage shore*  
*Where lay the blood and bone*  
*Of all of those who went before,*  
*To flounder, lost, alone.*  

They slowly passed and stopped to feast  
On *Friendster*'s broken wing -  
On *Myspace* (dead), and *Digg* (deceased) -  
On *Google Plus*, and *Ping*.

*And so it was the rest arrived -*  
*The best and bold, and how!*  
*And Reddit, King of Dank, survived,*  
*For good - for all - for now.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When days are long, and nights are tough -  
When winds are cold, and rolling rough -

*Then close your eyes, and think on this:*  
*There waits a first and furtive kiss*  
*For those who try for skies above.*  
*Be brave. Be bold.*

*And fall in love.*

:)"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There's nothing as lovely - as flawless and fine,  
As finding yourself in the fold of a spine -  
The turn of the paper; the print on the page;  
The scent of a story that's yellowed with age.

*I'll stand for a moment, and choose with a smile -*  
*For titles and covers are worth all the while.*  
*So keep all your kindles and kits to yourself -*  
*I'm hooked on the look of a book on a shelf!*
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I can't provide a chest of gold;  
Your weight in ruby rings;  
A cache of cash and treasures old,  
Or other fancy things -

*But we could sail upon a sigh,*  
*Or lie beneath the stars -*  
*And watch the simple shining sky*  
*For mercury and mars!*

We'll slowly ride the turning tide,  
And swim the ocean through –  
Or freely float and rolling, ride,  
Upon a boat for two!

*'It's you I need, and so -*  
*What say you, sweet? Shall we be wed?'*  

*She answered: 'Jesus, no.'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I still recall the fated day -  
The clouds were ripe with rain.  
The wind was cold. The sky was grey,  
In bitter shades of pain.

*I still recall the time with ease -*  
*The moment come to pass -*  
*My hopeless fall to haunted knees*  
*On shards of silver glass.*

I still recall the scene, it seems -  
The dismal sight in front.  
My shattered tank. My shattered *dreams*.

My brother's such a cunt."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'This paper's *amazing*!' she said with a smile -  
'An essay of wonder, of substance and style!

*'Well done then,' she whispered: 'a pleasure to read.'*  
*She handed it back with a nod of her head.*  

*'No sparkles,' she'd written. 'D minus', it said.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"We didn't know the rage of youth -  
We didn't see the signs;  
We didn't look to spy the truth,  
Or read between the lines.

*We didn't think to feel the threat -*  
*The storm of pain and pride;*  
*The masked, misguided silhouette*  
*That crept, corrupt, inside.*

We didn't hear the things we should -  
The coming, closing call.  
But then... I wonder how we could?  

There were no words at all."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Come nearer, lad,' my grandpa cried -  
A weak and weary sound.  
He sat, fatigued, then sadly sighed,  
And whispered: 'gather round.'

*His wistful words were weighed with woe -*  
*His grin was grim with grief.*  
*His voice was lost and lonely, low,*  
*Refusing all relief.*

'How sweet,' he said, 'to lead a life  
Of unrestricted joy -  
To never know the strain and strife  
Of yesteryear, my boy.

*'You'll never fear the fateful phone -*  
*The telling sound of sin -*

*To get a 'swift one' in.*  

'So seize the smut and clasp the crude!'  
He cried and threw his cap.  
I shook my head: 'Whatever dude.'

And went upstairs to fap.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"You build up a ladder with durable sides -  
With weight-bearing steps, and with even divides -  
It does what it's meant to. It does what it should.  
It's faultlessly flawless, and gorgeously good!  

*It's strong and it's shiny. It's nice and it's neat.*  
*It's perfect for purpose, constructed complete!*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Avast, me lads!' the crewman cried,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I rubbed my tender, aching head,  
And stared, bewildered, blind -

And blew my fucking mind.

*Perhaps, in fact, I'd missed the theme,*  
*And all the grit and grime*  
*Were fabled myths within a dream,*  
*Or metaphors for time -*

The searching snake; the ragged knife  
That sliced it from above -  
Perhaps it meant the pain of life  
And stark pursuit of love -

*Mercy given; pardon granted;*  
*Pious lessons prepped and planted;*  
*Proffered to their plea -*  

From the back erupt a thunder  
Rolling over, sideways, under,  
Till the mass, in woeful wonder,  
Turned in time to see - 

*Smiling, shameless, Sunday-suited,*  
*Sat a senior, pale, polluted:*  
*'Thank the lord that fart was muted!'*  
*So he spoke with glee.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"&gt;""One day Alice came to a fork in the road and saw a Cheshire cat in a tree. ""Which road do I take?"" she asked. ""Where do you want to go?"" was his response. ""I don't know,"" Alice answered. ""Then,"" said the cat, ""it doesn't matter."""" -- Alice in Wonderland

*

She came across a path that twinned  
Where sat, content, a cat:  
'The choice is yours,' it purred and grinned -  
'And *what* a choice, at that!'

*'The left departs – to what effect?*  
*The right returns a mile.*  
*But always all the ways connect,*  
*If only for a while!'*

'So which?' it winked with dark delight,

'If right is left, and left is right,  
Then which is *right*?' she said.

*'Whatever fate,' the cat replied,*  
*'Or fortune might befall -*  
*Unless you make a choice,' it sighed,*  
*'You’ll never move at all.'*

She stared ahead in thought and frowned,  
Then at the ground below -  
It wouldn't do to turn around...  

So *on* she chose to go."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The night was cold. The air was still,

A shadow shift and stirred.

*A figure stepped across the shade,*  
*And crept the hollow hall -*  
*As soundless as the moves it made,*  
*In subtle sneakings small.*

It stopped before a dusky door  
And took, with silent bliss,  
From out the clouded cloak it wore,  
A frozen puck of piss.

*It pushed the swiftly softened slice*  
*Beneath the narrow cleft -*  
*Then grinned with glee and hands of ice,*  
*And whispered 'Prick' and left.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Dear father,  

Now my daughter's born,  
I thought I ought to say -  
A word or two about the morn  
You upped and walked away.

*I still recall your simple smile -*  
*The way you shook your head.*  
*'I'm heading out for just a while*  
*To fetch some food,' you said.*

I watched you leave to get your snack,  
As any daughter would -  
And waited... 

But you're still not back.  

I hope it tasted good.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Oh gracious monster overlords

And shining ships of land and sea,

*I'll pen the finest rhyme on Earth*  
*To show the world your weight and worth!*  

'I'll spin a song of love and grace  
To compliment your master-race,  
Or rhyme a line in thoughts divine -  
If you'll allow this life of mine?

*'You see, perhaps the thing you need*  
*To spread your freaky foreign seed*  
*Across this little world of blue*  
*Is just the perfect word or two!*

It sighed aloud and shot me dead.  
I crumpled, crumbled, out of time.  

It muttered: 'what the fuck is rhyme?'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"She waited, frustrated, and screamed in despair:  
'Why can't it be different? Why can't it be fair?

Poem_for_your_sprog,"The portal colours fold and fade,  
And shift in shining beams -  
I stand within the summer's shade  
Of memories and dreams.

*The air is cool. The sound, serene -*  
*A silence I recall;*  
*Observed by Storm and Wolverine*  
*From posters on the wall.*

A voice I loved and lost to fate  
Comes floating through the door:  
'Come on!' she calls, 'or you'll be late!  
Don't wait a minute more!'
 
*And so I softly smile, and then,*  
*As stepping through the light,*  
*I sigh and say: 'There's time again...*  
*But now, I'll do it right.'*

In truth, my friend, the past has passed -  
Don't fret for what it's not.  
Just do your best to make it last,  
And give it all you've got."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Through the cell in which I'd woken,  
Hopeless, helpless, bitter, broken,  
Scraps of words and thoughts unspoken  
Stirred, misunderstood:

*Till I softly whispered, crying,*  
*All alone and silent-sighing...*  

*'Outlook not so good.'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I wish that I could write a rhyme  
In couplets, pure and plain -  
A verse to turn the hands of time,  
And take away the pain;

I'd pen a line to live and last,  
And *hold*, for what it's worth -  
Or try to softly spin the past,  
If words could change the earth.

But words are quick, and quickly end,  
And so I'll simply say -  
I'm sorry for the hurt, my friend,  
And innocence astray.

This world is often cruel and wrong,  
But still, I swear above -  
If folks like you are brave and strong,  
There's always hope - and *love*.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Weak of heart and hopeless, quaking,  
Soundless in the silent, shaking,  
Dead, destroyed, and empty station,  
There I lie in desolation -  
Homeless, haunted, ailing, aching;  
My foreordination. 

Whispered winds and distant thunder,  
Tumble over, sideways, under,  
As some half-remembered feeling  
Stirs a fallen thought, revealing  
Buried former worlds of wonder -  
Dreams to leave me reeling.

I remember, on that morning,  
Waking while the word was dawning,  
Hoping, hushed, that I was dreaming,  
As the headlines glittered, gleaming:  
  
'*Comcast: Sole Provider Warning.*'

... I remember screaming.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"There they sit with empty staring  
Concentration; hushed and glaring  
Glazed relations, overbearing,  
Watching, waiting, when...  

*'Open mine,' I hear, dumbfounded,*  
*Caught and captured, seized, surrounded;*  
*Smiling sweetly (haunted, hounded);*  
*Package passed, and then...*

Silence settles, softly skating

Expectation; wonder, waiting...  

Fucking *socks* again."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The sun goes down upon the Ankh,  
And slowly, softly fades -  
Across the Drum; the Royal Bank;  
The River-Gate; the Shades.

A stony circle's closed to elves;  
And here, where lines are blurred,  
Between the stacks of books on shelves,  
A quiet '*Ook*' is heard.

A copper steps the city-street  
On paths he's often passed;  
The final march; the final beat;  
The time to rest at last.

He gives his badge a final shine,  
And sadly shakes his head -  
While Granny lies beneath a sign  
That says: 'I aten't dead.'

The Luggage shifts in sleep and dreams;  
It's now. The time's at hand.  
For where it's always night, it seems,  
A timer clears of sand.

And so it is that Death arrives,  
When all the time has gone...  
But dreams endure, and hope survives,  
And Discworld carries on.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Perhaps, at last, when time has passed,

*Or etched their scars across the stars*

The perfect love to share.  
A life to find a kindred mind...  

Is *so* un-fucking-fair."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When the sun's set to set in a sweet season's sky;  
When the stars shimmer down, and the moon's passing by;  
When a summer-wind skips; when it blows in the trees –  

I'll remember your touch by the feel of the breeze.

*When the clouds disappear, like it was here before;*  
*When the white-breakers break, and the tide meets the shore;*  
*When the rain tumbles down onto still, silver lakes –*  

*I'll remember your smile in the ripples it makes.* 

When the stars fade to dawn; when the dawn turns to day;  
When the summer-wind carries the rainclouds away;  
When the tide travels in, and the sunlight has set –  

I will miss you forever, and never forget.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I still recall her touch in truth -  
Her eager, questing kiss;  
Our clumsy escapade of youth -  
Our adolescent bliss.

*Our passions, heaven-sent -*  
*And in that ageless, perfect time,*  
*Forever came and went.*

I felt the earth and stars collide  
Betwixt our burning skin -  
And as I lay, relaxed and sighed,  
She whispered... 'is it in?'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I sighed aloud and shook the gun -  
The empty rifle, cocked.  
The time had come; my days were done;  
The exit barred and blocked.

*It stood in front and swayed in place*  
*With moans and eerie sighs;*  
*With decomposing fetid face,*  
*And soulless bloodshot eyes.*

The creature met my gaze and cried -  
A shriek of monstrous glee.  
'You think you've got it hard?' I sighed -  
'Well not as hard as me!'

*Without the walking dead!'*  
*It kindly muttered: 'man, that's rough.'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Though rather dependent on topic and time -  
On mood and on metre; on rhythm and rhyme -  
A normal reply on a thread of a night

*If funny or foolish; if silly or sweet -*  
*Then these are the quickest there are to complete.*  
*If sad or if serious, bitter, or blue -*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I saw it before me in shadows of doubt -

I'm ending it here, of an evening, alone.'  
I reached out before me... and picked up the phone."

&gt;Can I get crabs in my beard if my girlfriend has crabs and I eat her out?

*Top Answer:*

What a pleasure to read of the dignified deed,  
And the chivalrous vision in sight -  
For the amorous state too persistent of late  
Has been lacking the courteous knight!

*Like yourself, I'm a man with an honourable plan,*  
*And a sense of the right and the wrong -*  
*A benevolent sage for a scandalous age,*  
*With a principled fortitude strong!*

I've traditional names for *m'ladies* and dames,  
But to answer your question as well  
(My companion revered, with your wonderful beard) -  

Yes you can, and it's itchy as hell.

*

&gt;Where can I meet Edward Cullen?

*Top Answer:*

Alas, it seems it falls to me  
To speak the hardest truth -  
When lies sustain the purity,  
And innocence of youth.

*I'm sorry, kid; you'll never find,*  
*No matter what your age,*  
*The man you seek but in your mind,*  
*And on the printed page.*

Don't fret or fear or shed a tear,  
For here, upon this Earth -  
You'll find a finer equal, dear,  
In time, for what it's worth.

&gt;What significance did the Battle of Trafalgar have for naval trade in Spain?

*Top Answer:*

How outstanding! How elating  
That I saw your question waiting -  
What a truly fascinating  
Query come to pass!

*Any student here demanding*  
*Careful, clever understanding*  
*Profits from my keen, commanding,*  
*Expertise en masse!*

Here's my well-informed perspective,  
With regard to your objective -  
I'm your *teacher*, damned defective.  

See me after class.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"A smiling sun - an ancient oak,  
With clouds that billow by -  
A chimney blowing swirls of smoke,  
Beneath a navy sky.

*A home on lost and lovely land;*  
*A pure and perfect scene -*  
*A family standing hand in hand,*  
*On grass of gold and green.*

She laughs her light, familiar way  
Beside the bedroom door -  
'It's you and me - it's *us*,' I say...  

Just like it was before.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"On a wind-swept winter morning,  
As the sun was rising, dawning,  
There I sat and stretching, yawning,  
Stopped and softly sighed:

*'I've a question far exceeding*  
*All the normal queries needing*  
*Answers from the rabble reading!'*  
*So I spoke with pride.*

Thus I asked with hope, elated,  
Till I read the words that waited -  
Quit the site and, nauseated,  
Showered till I cried."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"My little sister sat beside,  
Her mouth an 'O' of fear -  
I swallowed hard with shaking pride,  
Resolved to disregard the guide,  
And boldly go where once denied,  
With conscience clean and clear.

*'They'll know,' she whispered, white with fright,*  
*And troubled, fretful, frown -*  
*I heard the words with dark delight -*  
*'They'll know!' she cried; 'it isn't right!'*  
*I didn't care. I clicked the site.*

    'High traffic. Page is down.'
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I remember your smile with the sun in your eyes,  
And the smell of the summer, the sound of the breeze -  
I remember your shape under powder-blue skies;  
Under wandering clouds; under whispering trees.

*I remember the feel of the grass at our back,*  
*And the touch of its warmth, and the cool of the shade,*  
*And the calls of our friends from the river-way track,*  
*And the season that last for an age when it stayed.*

I remember the fire we built of a night,  
And the sight of the stars as they slipped in a stream,  
And the furtive first-kiss that we shared by its light,  
And the simple, impossible, innocent dream.

*I remember you most in the starlight above,*  
*But for you it was fun - and for me it was love.*
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'*Hear me stool*!' I cried, confounded,  
Rectum wrecked, and punished, pounded,  
Straining sobs of sorrow sounded,  
Steeped in deepest woe.

*'End your fecal-incubation!*  
*Stop your sphincter-strangulation!*  
*Make your way to sweet salvation*  
*Round the bend below!*  

'Leave!' I shrieked with shrinking saneness -  
'Take your horrid, hateful, heinous,  
Stench from out my aching anus,  
Fated fetid foe!'

*Every whistle, every clenching,*  
*Drastic diarrhea-drenching,*  
*Gurgle-babble, bottom-wrenching,*  
*Seemed to whisper... 'no'.*

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Oh Saint Vanilla, far above,  
In godly spectral light -  
Protect me with your hateful love,  
And keep me safe at night.

*'The world's a dark and awful place*  
*For honest folk, refined -*  
*A harmless word regarding race,*  
*The masses lose their mind!*

'Oh Saint Vanilla, spirit strong -  
You have to make them see!  
You'll have to teach them right from wrong,  
And *tolerance*... for me.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Thanks for this.

Happy New Year everyone :)

'Sonnet MMXV'

Friends and acquaintances, lend me your ears!  
Now is the time and the rhyme for goodbyes!  
Whether a year-full of laughter or tears,  
Bid your farwell to the lows and the highs!

*All of the lessons you've lived through and learned -*  
*All of the loss and the love in your mind -*  
*All of the blows and the bruises you've earned -*  
*Carry them with you, or leave them behind!*

Pause for a ponder and see that it's true -  
Every beginning begins with an end.  
Out with the olden times, in with the new!  
Make what you will of the future, my friend.

*Here's to the chance in the change of the scene -*  
*Here's to tomorrow, and twenty-fifteen!*

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'When you wake,' my father sighed  
To see me awe-struck, starry-eyed,  
'You'll find inside your pockets, boy,  
The special stuff of dreaming joy!'

*I closed my eyes with hope and glee,*  
*And dreamt with such expectancy -*  
*An itsy ship! A gold doubloon!*  
*A teeny-tiny shining moon!*

Of course, I should have known the truth -  
For all that really waits for youth  
Are broken hopes, and broken dreams...  

And pockets full of cum, it seems.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There, as though from hope and wonder,  
Tearing teenage-dreams asunder,  
Peeked a certain organ-under,  
Bald, and boldly bared.

*Though she glanced away, uncaring,*  
*'It' was searching, seeking, staring -*  
*Held me in its gaze, and glaring,*  
*Caught me unprepared.*

'*Look*,' it seemed to say, and smiling,  
Offered up its bait beguiling;  
So I saved the sight for filing,  
Rapt and sweetly-snared.

*I was lost, and we were stranded -*  
*'Grab your oar!' the coach commanded -*  
*'Fucking which?' I answered candid...*  

*Everybody stared.*
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Though just a tiny wall of text,  
I pondered, loath to read it next,  
Then bid the piece an *au revoir* -  
Until I spied 'TL;DR.'

*'What ever's this?' I thought, with glee -*  
*'A kinky little mystery?*  
*A naughty maid that's made for more?*  
*The Help to help the helpless score?'* 

'Oh *yes*,' thought I - 'it's worth the read!  
A sexcapade is fine indeed!'  
And so I chose to pause than pass...  

But rather hoped for more, alas.
 "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"While feasting on the tears of thralls  
And melted mozzarella-balls,  
The Righteous Democratic Head  
Of Noble North Korea said:  

*'My faithful aides, we win again!*  
*Before us stand two fallen men!'*  
*He cried with pride: 'Now make amends*  
*For all your lies, my phoney friends!'*  

In front, one sat with squinting eyes -  
One laughed a laugh you'd recognise.  
They shared a look, then shrugged instead...  

And shot the chubby bastard dead.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Her eyes were dark and narrowed thin -  
Her mouth, a solid line.  
I took a breath, and with a grin,  
Ignored the warning sign.

*Perhaps a smarter (safer) man*  
*Would leave the thought unsaid -*  
*But I was caught. She saw the plan,*  
*And slowly shook her head.*

And this was *it* - the time, the place,  
The moment, ripe and rare.  
'Well, that'll- *ow*!'  

She slapped my face.
  
And said: 'bitch, don't you *dare*.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The dean of studies stood to say:  
'Perhaps you haven't heard -  
In culinary class today,  
A *ghastly* thing occurred.' 

*'We ask that every student brings*  
*The parts for pies and cake -*  
*Or other fancy foody things,*  
*To whip and beat and bake.'*

He swallowed hard and shook his head:  
'And that's all nice and neat -  
But if you *sampled* stuff,' he said...  
'You'd better take a seat.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I rhyme in my thoughts, and I rhyme when I dream -  
I write in the night to a structure and scheme!  
A line's not enough, and a lyric won't do -  
I'd rather compose half a poesy or two! 

*A song for a sonnet; a ditty defined;*  
*An ode that I've sewed from a sound in my mind;*  
*A beat for a verse on whatever I see -*  
*A cute little couplet in stanzas of three!*

I do it with joy, and I'd do it for good -  
I'd write for a living, if only I could!  
You see - though I'm sure that you'd never have guessed...  

I'm utterly, totally, fucking obsessed."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'When all our clothes are out of style,  
And days are fair and few -  
I'll stand before the end and smile,  
So long as I have you.

*No matter what the seasons bring -*  
*No matter what should be -*  
*I'll know that I had everything...*  
*If you still blush for me.'*

:)"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I've heard it said before in rhyme,  
To speak of loss and pain:  
'While open cuts will heal in time,  
The hidden scars remain.'

*They're buried, caught and kept in sighs;*  
*In doubts, and broken dreams;*  
*In broken hopes and homes and cries,*  
*And broken hearts, it seems.*  

And yet, one day the pain will ease -  
You'll wake, and when it's cleared -  
Those scars will serve as memories  
For how you persevered. 
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"If you can stand for all to see,  
And swear, with earnest truth,  
It didn't come from enmity,  
But ignorance of youth - 

*Then hold your head up high, my friend,*  
*And let it fade at last -*  
*It's right to care, but in the end,*  
*The lesson's learned and passed.*

The young are slow to understand,  
And foolish through and through.  

You didn't think to lend a hand...  

But *you* would, wouldn't you?
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"One evening, tired and tucked in bed,  
My father sat beside and said  
(With unexpected, sudden joy):  
'*You've won the game of life, my boy!*'

He laughed aloud with deep delight:  
'An 'X' and 'Y', and white as white!  
What better start to life, my lad,  
Could any father hope was had?'

He clapped my back and cried with glee:  
'Oh surely fortunes favour me!  
To have a son with fairer skin,  
Of fewer parts eumelanin!'

And so it was across the years,  
Until his pride had turned to tears.  
I 'won' - but all the same, you see...
   
I'm thirty-six, and five-foot-three.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"There I hunched in silence waiting,  
Sudden happy thoughts abating,  
Satisfaction turned to hating,  
Stomach creased in cramp.

*Boldly through the dark I'd blundered,*  
*Toilet-tissue picked and plundered,*  
*Till it was, at last, I wondered*  
*What was soft and damp.*

Shadows through the dark proceeded -  
'*Go away!*' I cried, unheeded.  
'Leave me here to die!' I pleaded.  

God, I hated camp."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When thirty hit, and life had slowed,  
One day I woke and saw -  
It wasn't 'fun', my life and load,  
Not like it was before.

*I didn't have the room for 'fun',*  
*Or fleeting, brief affairs -*  
*I'd traded 'fun' for jobs begun,*  
*And duties, bonds, and cares -*

For costly baby-carriages;  
For picket-fences grey;  
For mortgages and marriages,  
And business rooms and pay.

*And that was it, or so I thought -*  
*A life of finished youth.*  
*A life of missing all I ought...*  
*Until I learned the truth.*

In time, those things I thought were sweet -  
The 'wonders' youth contained -  
They couldn't ever match or meet  
The love and life I'd gained.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"In shops and in classes across the UK,  
The doorways are padlocked and closed for the day.  
The hallways are silent; the offices shut -  
No queues are enjoyed, or denounced with a tut.

*The streets are devoid of the young and the old,*  
*With tea-cups in coffee-shops empty and cold.*  
*There's no one in wait for a bus or a train,*  
*Complaining politely and standing in rain.*

There's fish and there's chips still awaiting the fat -  
And though it's improper and vulgar at that,  
A call caterwauls through the silence serene:  

'The Prince got his end away, god save the queen!'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I'd love to have your life a while,  
And share, for moments brief,  
Your confidence, your easy smile -  
Your self-assured belief!

*'You catch the eyes of girls and guys,*  
*With style and wit to spare -*  
*And when they're cruel or criticise,*  
*You never seem to care!*

'I'd love that same security -  
Too bold and brave for doubt!'

I nod and smile.  

I have to be.

To drown the panic out. 

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I have my say,' say I, with pride;  
I say, '*my say*', and feel inside  
A shiny sense of warmth and worth -  
For I've my part and place on Earth.

*'My say,' I say, 'is worth the same*  
*As any folk of funds or fame,*  
*For I've,' say I, with cherished glee,*  
*'A voice in my democracy.'*

And so it is I sleep at night,  
And know that all is well and right -  
While golden men on business boards  
All have *their* say... and mine, and yours."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The students whined and griped and groaned -  
They sighed aloud and moped and moaned;  
'This sucks!' said one, with tortured face,  
'And what's a 'henge', in any case?'

*'A 'henge', described as scholars might,'*  
*Said I, with well-informed delight*  
*(And answer pre-prepared and penned),*  
*'Refers to this, my puzzled friend:*

'A Neolithic earthwork shape  
(Of rather sweet and splendid scape),  
With inner ditch, and space inside  
No more than twenty-metres wide.'

*A circle, stone or timber-through,*  
*May form a funky feature too*  
*(Though note, for intellective's sake,*  
*A 'henge', their presence doesn't make.)*

And now you know!' said I, content -  
'An outing well and truly spent!  
What say you, boy of brighter wit?'  

He said: 'It's really fucking shit.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*'Different Standards'*

They giggled, laughed, and grinned with joy,  
Until, an unsuspecting boy,  
Ensnared inside the moment's whirl,  
Exclaimed: 'You're funny... for a girl!'

I turned and grinned with malcontent.  
He caught my eye - '*I only meant*,'  
The boy began, before a pause  
To ditch his rather hopeless cause.

'*Oh no*,' said I, with gracious glee,  
And phony smile for all to see;  
'You're right, of course! The world around  
Has *always* known that humour's found  
Not in the use of cunning wit  
Or anecdotes as might befit  
The finer moments such as these,  
With folks of either sex at ease!  
A woman's sense of humour, see,  
Is lost inside an ovary! 
 
The funny's made and meant for men,  
And so it stands to reason then  
(And here's the truth, and ain't it slick?) -  

*It must be found inside a dick*!  

So ponder that a little while,  
'Cos boy... you never make me smile.'

The others laughed with pure delight -  
'I'm sorry,' said the first, contrite.  
His eyes were wet, and set to cry.  

'Ew, *stop* - you're meant to be a guy.'
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Upon a certain site one night  
(With plans for posting next),  
The room was bright with sudden light -  
My phone received a text.

*'We loved your latest post!' it said,*  
*'As every user ought!*  
*That funny smell beneath your bed -*  
*A cumbox, who'd have thought?*  

'Your father laughed so hard he cried!'  
It said with joyful glee -  
I hung my head and sadly sighed:  
'Dear mom... stop texting me.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I sat there in silence, perplexed and alone.  
'Just say what you see,' said the voice on the phone;  
Frustrated, he'd sighed when he answered my call -  
'There's nothing,' said I, 'not a thing there at all.'

'There's *nothing*?' he scoffed, and he chuckled with scorn:  
'There's nothing!' I answered, fed-up and forlorn.  
'Come look for yourself and you'll see that it's true -  
My screen's gone all dark and there's *nothing* to do!'

Indignant, he hung up the phone with a sigh.  
He stood, with a venomous glint in his eye,  
Then stomped through the office with arrogant glee...  

And in to the void where my screen used to be.  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"While lost in thoughts and feeling fine -  
Not happy; neither sad -  
A well-intentioned friend of mine  
Gave all the best she had.

*'Cheer up and chill!' she cried with force;*  
*'Think positive, you know?*  
*You never have to smile, of course,*  
*But would it kill you though?'*

I sighed aloud, then turned my head,  
And grinned from ear to ear.  
'It won't, but all the same,' I said...  
 
'It just might kill *you*, dear.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"We ate in sight of stars at night,  
And shared a velvet wine -  
And there, beneath the candle-light,  
He curled his hand in mine.

*I'd been alone so long it seemed*  
*My days were cold and grim -*  
*But he was all I'd ever dreamed;*  
*I found a hope in him.* 

And so I pictured years ahead -  
A lovely, loving life.  
He stared into my eyes and said...  

'You wanna buy a knife?'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There they sat, and salivating,  
Watched with wanton hunger waiting;  
Eyes like raptors, bound for baiting  
Someone's pointless plea.

*So they gathered round in bleakness;*  
*Marked my movements; noted weakness;*  
*Laughed to see my muted meekness,*  
*Grinning grim with glee.*

They were beasts of desolation -  
I was pale in perspiration...  
Man, that fucking presentation  
Really sucked for me.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I'll not forget the words he said,'  
I sighed aloud and shook my head -

*'You do your job, and big or small -*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I used to long for sleep at night

*But sailing's so much harder now,*

I'll stay awake a while and take  
The comfort here, and then -  
Perhaps, at last, I'll dream to wake  
In amber light again."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"As the wind starts to blow on a cold winter's night,  
By the light of the moon and the flickering glow

*There I stand and delay, while I ponder my act;*  
*My exact execution; my moment astray.*  
*I am king for a day, irrefutable fact...*  
*For I hacked the whole planet, and I got away.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I wandered the stairwell, postponing the meet;  
A mind full of horror and anxious retreat.

*He knew all the secrets and where to begin;*  
*The 'ones' and the 'zeroes'; the knowledge arcane -*  
*I stepped through the firewall and joined his domain.* 

And there was the wizard - the keeper of kits;  
Of linux and javascript, coding and bits.  
'What is it?' he whispered, from out of the murk...  

'My laptop's got gunk in it, please make it work.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Who's that guy in destitution,

Breathing in his own pollution,

Desperate, dirty, shocking, shameless,  
Roving beggar, numb and nameless?

Poem_for_your_sprog,"We used to share our souls, it seemed,  
When every day was new.  
And every hope and dream I dreamed  
Was meant for me and you.

*I thought, perhaps, I'd thought it out -*

*There wanders back a creeping doubt*  
*To stay a while again.*

But no.

It's not to be."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The room was cold. The air was still.  
No word escaped a lip until,

*He stood, a beast, at eight foot tall,*  
*And said, without an ounce of joy:*  
*'You'd better have your reasons boy.'*

I looked around the room for aid,  
But not a sound or move was made.  
A second passed.  
A second more.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Apart, afraid, and lost, alone,  
With aching, heavy heart -  
I woke each day, and on my own,  
Alone, the day would start.

*Just maybe, for a little while,*

I shared their table too -

The 'shadows' that the scan detects;  
The sudden, bloody sneeze;  
The symptomatic side-effects  
Of some unseen disease.

*The ragged, closing breath.*  
*For I am time.*  
*And I am age.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"We listened and listened, but nothing was found -  
No intricate signal, no alien sound;  
No link from a world in a galaxy bright,  
But desolate silence, and limitless night. 

We listened and listened, with nothing to hear -  
No cosmic crescendo, no harmony near;  
No twitch of a pitch, nor a note from the stars,  
But spiritless stillness, and echoes from Mars.

We listened and listened - until it all *changed*.  
A sound in the darkness, a message exchanged;  
A voice from the cluster uncharted by men;  
Recorded and printed, repeated again. 

We listened and listened - with growing despair.  
'*We cede to your mercy, and yield to your care.*  
*They're coming*,' it said, and the message was through.  
*'They're coming.* 

*They're coming.* 

*They'll come for you too.'*"

The groaning gulf beneath the wave;

The drowned abyss; the sunken grave  
Where shadows shift in sleep;

*Atop that empty chasm, tossed,*  
*And setting stiff as stone;*  
*Apart, adrift, abandoned, lost...*  
*I fought to float, alone.*"

The Gotham City air was still,  
While Tommy, Chucky, Phil, and Lil,  
And Ed, and Edd, and Eddy too,  
All wondered what on earth to do.

*No jokes were told. No sounds were made.*  
*They stared beyond their screens that day...*  
*Where no one sat to see them play.*"

Said earnest Ernest Hemingway,  
'To tell the world, from town to town  
Across the river, up and down,  
And under seas and over lands  
Where old men wander foreign sands,  
By suns that rise at true first light  
For whom the bell should toll at night,  
When passing islands in the stream,  
The only thing of which I dream -  
The only thing I'll ever love -  
To have and have not from above -  
The finest thing I'll ever need!
  
My jolly jackets made of tweed.'"

*Other city sounds competing*

A guest arose and shouted: 'Dudes,  
Let fall your plates of munch!

*Put down your savoured snacks with haste,*  
*And listen close to me -*  
*There's not a finer food to taste*  
*Than what you're soon to see!'*

Intrigued, the others raised their eyes,  
With knives and forks apart.  
He cupped his balls and said: 'Surprise!  
My bollocks, à la carte.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Listen lad,' he said that morning  
While I waited, worn and yawning,  
As the sun came slowly dawning,  
Golden sky aglow:

*'Life's a wave of rain and thunder*  
*Raging up and over-under,*  
*Splitting every sail asunder,*  
*Backwards, to and fro.*

Stand before it stalwart, waiting;  
Ever-more anticipating  
Smoother seas with storms abating,  
When those tempests blow.

*Face the world with grit and daring!*  
*Stand up strong and true, declaring:*  
*'I've a heart and soul for sharing!'*  
*... fuck the leechers though.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"As one, we watched the mountains pass -  
The hills returned to planes of grass  
That stretched a thousand miles or more  
Before the freighter's open door.

*With pack in hand, my father sighed.*  
*My mother sat and silent, cried*  
*To see it go; 'adieu', she said,*  
*Then closed the door and shook her head.*

'But why, maman?' I asked, forlorn,  
That summer's day: that faded morn.  
'For love - for life,' she answered quick...  

'Your father needs his tiny dick.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It often seems I've skipped a rung  
Some days, for what it's worth.  
I've missed a step - I've slipped and swung  
To some peculiar Earth.

*On days like these, those moments tossed*  
*Emerge with careless haste -*  
*To leave me hopeless, hurt and lost,*  
*With bitter truths to taste.*

I'm sure it seems absurd to hear  
I'd grieve to let him go -  
I'd close my eyes and shed a tear  
For guys I didn't know -  
  
*But all the same - I will a while.*  
*That man I never met -*  
*The man that made me laugh and smile -*  
*I never shall forget.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'They didn't see my pain or tears.  
I woke, forever blind.  
A thousand heartaches filled my ears,  
And madness filled my mind.

*They clamoured round my every thought,*  
*And clawed their way inside -*  
*The shadows ripped and rolled and caught,*  
*With every word they cried.*

They moaned and groaned and writhed above,  
Below, and all around -  
For hope and dreams; for loss and love,  
In shackles, wrought and bound.

*I heard their tales in haunted parts -*  
*Their stories from before.*  
*I felt their broken homes and hearts,*  
*I felt...*

*Forevermore.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Well goodness me, what's happened here?'  
Exclaimed the man beside.  
'It rather seems we're stuck, my dear.  
Oh, what a shame!' he cried. 

*'This elevator's awful small*  
*For you, my love, and me -*  
*And I've no treats or sweets at all.*  
*Oh, what a place to be!'*

'We've not a single thing to eat -  
Unless...' he turned his head,  
'You'd like to share the sweetest meat  
You'll ever taste,' he said.

*'A ladyfinger - two or ten!*  
*The finest food you'll find!'*  
*The lift began to move again.*  
*'A pity. Nevermind.'*


"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'You going up?' I smiled and said,  
Then gestured to the door  
(In silent hope he'd shake his head,  
Or choose another floor.)

*He slapped his thighs and stepped inside,*  
*'These legs aren't what they were!'*  
*(I felt, in fear, the coming tide,*  
*With vision all a blur.)*

You know that famous movie scene?  
The lift that's full of blood?  
You know it, right? The one I mean?  
Well that was us with crud."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"With hope and faith; with love and glee -  
They held it up for all to see.  
'With this,' they said, 'we'll know the past -  
We'll watch and learn the truth at last.

*You see, inside this humble kit,*  
*We saw the note; the holy writ -*  
*A message, cut and carved and sliced:*  
*'If found, return to Jesus Christ.'*

The room was cold. The air was still.  
No sound emerged at all, until  
A priest arose that fated day,  
And pressed the little tiny '*play*'.

*It started up. They held their breath.*  
*They thought of faith; of life and death,*  
*And watched the picture come and go:*  
*'That's it,' they said... 'and now we know.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Beneath the dusky bar-room light,  
He saw her 'cross the room.  
Her beauty shone and split the night  
From out the shade and gloom.

*He flexed his arms, then winked and said:*  
*'What up? I'm toned and tough.'*  
*'Not interested,' she shook her head.*  
*He whispered... 'that's the stuff.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Below the sun at dawn of day,  
With heart of gold and feet of clay,  
In armoured plate and shining shield -  
He stood before the battlefield.

*The war had raged an endless night*  
*Of pain and plight; of fear and fight*  
*And flight - retreat, to pause and pray,*  
*Then turn again to chance the fray.*

With woe, he watched that shade of hell,  
As frightened soldiers fought and fell  
Beneath the blind, uncaring sun -  
Until, at last, his foe had won.

*'What happened, lad?' he asked a boy*  
*Who stood beside and sighed: 'A ploy*  
*Of pain,' he cried in disbelief...*  
*'They even used wet-willies, chief!'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"My grandpa said his father swore  
There walked a mighty herd before  
'So full and free, for what it's worth,  
Its coming rocked and shook the earth!'

*In awe, I pondered at his words -*  
*The thought of roving, roaming herds*  
*So full of life that where they'd go*  
*Their hoof-steps stirred the ground below.*

I looked around, from left to right...  
And saw no bird or beast in sight.  
'Where are they all?' at last, I said -  
He sadly smiled, and shook his head."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*'Too far fatigued that fateful day*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'*Why?!*' I thought, aghast, with wonder,  
As she tore my pride asunder -  
Every laugh a clap of thunder  
Round my aching head.

*'Is it me?' I cried with feeling;*  
*'Am I gross and unappealing?'*  
*'No!' she fought for breath and reeling,*  
*Crawled across the bed.*

'You're...' (she spoke with acclamation)  
'Just...' (she screamed with adoration)  
'Freaking *huge*!' (with exaltation)...  
'Sweet,' I smiled and said."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"From far below, the eerie throe  
And howling horrors came -  
And not a sound the world around  
Was ever quite the same.

*It soared afloat on rising note*  
*With every 'mayday!' cried -*  
*Until, in awe, I gaped before*  
*My mother turned and sighed.*

'Don't worry, dear, or fret and fear,'  
She frowned to disapprove -  
'It's just the pricks in ninety-six...  
I wish they'd fucking move.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young, I hoped I'd be  
A hero sailing sea to sea -  
I dreamt of shining knights and shields;  
Of chivalry and battlefields.

*I always thought I'd view the Earth*  
*From far above, for what it's worth;*  
*I wished I'd find a way to fly,*  
*Or make my own before I die.*

But wishes fade with age and bend -  
And all I want before the end  
Is just as hard to find, it seems,  
As stars and knights, and hopes and dreams."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I idolized that kid in school -  
His clothes, his hair, his style;  
That quintessential case of cool,  
All fawning friends and smile.

*'It's theirs for now,' my mother said -*  
*'And then, one day, it's passed.'*  
*And so it was each night in bed,*  
*I hoped it wouldn't last.*

And then it came - she knew it would -  
But on that promised night...  
It didn't feel as half as good  
As once I thought it might."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Before his third inaugural speech  
(A crafty act beyond the reach  
Of chiefs before, and all at that),  
His bodyguards, impatient, sat.

*'He's late again,' the captain said,*  
*Then sighed aloud and shook his head.*  
*He placed his card - a diamond ten,*  
*Then sadly checked his watch again.*

'I wouldn't mind,' he said, 'at all  
If just, perhaps, he'd text or call -  
But *no*,' he cried, and bet a dime -  
'With him, it happens every time!'

*And so it was, not far away,*  
*Obama called Michelle to say:*  
*'I'm overdue, and late to boot...*  
*But honey, where's my super-suit?'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Oh go, my dear! You're sure to find  
The perfect match! A kindred mind  
To share your days and share your nights -  
To roam the world and see the sights!' 

*And so she went... and there he stood.*  
*Her date - a man the doctor should*  
*Have turned around, in truth, at birth,*  
*For womankind - perhaps the Earth.*

His face was mostly overbite.  
His shirt said '*Hitler had it right!*'  
His eyes were small. His teeth were bad.  
He stank of crap. His name was Chad.

*'Hello!' he screamed, with eyes ablaze:*  
*'You wanna play the mayonnaise?*  
*I'm racist, sexist, bald and old,*  
*But I can cook!'*

*She whispered: 'Sold.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Without this fine, fantastic site  
To surf and spend my time -  
I never would have thought to write  
A verse or two in rhyme.

*It might not sound that much at all...*  
*But it's a lot to me.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The gathered crowd and field of dreams!  
The cup and balls! The tops and teams!  
The commentators talk, and then -  
The World-Cup Final starts again!

... and so I sat, expecting more -  
A heap of tackles! Goals galore!  
I watched...  
... and watched...  
... and waited, bored...  
While moments passed, and no one scored.

The seconds clocked a minute more -  
They ticked and tocked their last before  
The hour ebbed in extra-time –  
And as I paused to pen this rhyme,  
So Germany, in earnest ran,  
As fast as any German can,  
Until, a blur of triumph, fast,  
They took the chance – and scored...  
*At last*!"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'You worked a job through college, kid,  
And couldn't fund the fee?  
You took a loan to pay your way  
In university?

*You got the finest average, kid,*  
*Your teacher's ever seen?*  
*The highest fuckin' GPA,*  
*Whatever that might mean?*

You graduated better, kid,  
And thought to find your feet?  
The world collapsed, and now you say  
You can't afford to eat?

*Well let me tell you something, kid,*  
*When all's been said and done -*  
*You're just not trying hard, okay?*  
*... you got it easy, son.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Oh Mary, the world's still a wonderful sight -  
Just hanging there silent, surrounded by night.  
If my story ends here, alone, floating free -  
I don't think I'll mind it's the last that I'll see.

*I've thought of your grace in the starlight, and then -*  
*I'd hoped and I'd prayed that I'd see you again.*  
*I can't help but wonder, if somewhere in town,*  
*Are you looking up dear, while I'm looking down?*

When dreams are forgotten, and all hope has gone,  
When promises stolen, this life carries on -  
I'll wait for a while, while the engines run low;  
I'll think of your smile, and I'll want you to know:

*I'm picturing you under warm summer skies -*  
*I'm thinking of us, and I'm closing my eyes.*  
*It's this that I wanted, but never forget -*  
*I'd trade it for you, and a moment more yet.'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Your father's days are almost done,

*It might seem cruel or callous, dear,*  
*But that's the honest truth!'*

'So leave him be! He's pipped and passed,'  
She sighed and shook her head -  
Until, that is, he turned at last,

*Than all my days with you.'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Outside the university -  
To watch the students pass -  
A hobo stood in sleazy glee,  
And catcalled: 'Oh! Dat ass.'

*The student, turned from where she'd come,*  
*With jaded, weary sigh,*  
*Said: 'Get an education, bum!'*  
*And bid the tramp goodbye.*

A later day, she shook her head  
To see him watch her go -  
Until, that is, he smiled and said...  
'Dat callipygian tho.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young, I thought that love  
Was heaven sent from stars above -  
I thought that love was diamond rings  
And sonnets sung on harper's strings.

*I dreamt, afraid, I'd never know*  
*The soul-mate sole for me, and so*  
*I feared a future on my own;*  
*A life to live apart, alone.*

I filled my days, from end to end,  
With every hollow, empty friend  
That I could ever hope to see;  
To stand, alone, in company. 

*And so it was I thought to find*  
*A better path; a change of mind -*  
*I'd rather never second-guess,*  
*Than settle, safe, for something less.*"

Now we could shine a light or blink  
An LED to judge the hue -  
But some might get it wrong and think  
That light is rather airy too!  

*So let us start and so begin*  
*With something else: a vacuum-chest*  
*To place the cutest kitten in*  
*And wait a quarter-hour, at best!*

Then when it's swollen-up,' he smiled,  
'We'll take a pin and pop it dead,  
Like so - all done!

*Stop crying, child.*  

I told you that the blood was red.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I have to sort my books!' she cried,  
With self-indulgent glee;  
With senseless, narcissistic pride:

*Then left without a peep -*  
*And washed my hands until they bled,*  
*And cried myself to sleep.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Upon a leather couch beside  
A desk of darkest oak,  
She sobbed and dried the tears she cried  
With every word she spoke:

*Her smile was weak and strained.*

She said with knotted brow,  
'I hear his laugh; our haunted screams  
Forever - even now.

*The dark and dread! The fear! The shame!'*

*'The day that Princess Leia came*  
*And scared us all to shit!'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When Daisy Moo went marching through  
The farmer's lands one afternoon,  
Without a peep, the cows and sheep,  
And roaming bands of coots and 'coon,  
Departed, 'fraid to see it soon.

*They gathered round and talked and frowned*  
*And muttered words of discontent*  
*To see her there without a care,*  
*Where once their herds had gaily spent*  
*Their days with food the farmer sent.*

And so they glared as Daisy stared  
Alone and sick, before she stood  
And mooed and retched with legs outstretched,  
Rotating quick, as best she could -  
As all had sadly known she would.

*And when she'd spun her last and done,*  
*They asked, in time, 'are you okay?'*  
*She whispered, pleased: 'you're all diseased,*  
*Bar me! For I'm,' they heard her say,*

'I'm practiced in rhythm

So here comes the expert  
Perspective, post-haste:  
It isn't a matter  
of personal taste.

*Or a melody whole -*  
*Should resonate, darling,*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'This eras such a mystery -

*And writhed with Anne Boleyn.*

'Now note the fancy dress and ruff,  
And breath-mints by the score -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'When days are hard and nights are tough -  
When rivers course their journey rough -

To think that life was made for this.'"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"In dead of night, I lie awake;  
A tempest blows - the windows shake.  
My parents sleep a slumber, sweet...  
I creep downstairs on silent feet.

*The system starts - a sound of dread,*  
*Enough to raise the damned and dead!*  
*And while it sighs and cries and whirs,*  
*I wait in fear... but nothing stirs.*

I wipe my brow at noise unplanned  
(With tissue firmly clenched in hand),  
And mind a storm of joy and shame;  
Of weighted risk; of chance and blame.

*And so it is, with bated breath,*  
*In nervous sweats, and scared to death*  
*Behind a sombre, shining screen,*  
*I swallow hard... and choose 'eighteen.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It rose on spongy tides of ooze

*A medley sweetened, shaped and warmed,*  
*And microwaved to sludge.*

'Are you alright?' my husband said,  
And through the doorway stepped.  
With spoon in hand, I shook my head...  
Then ate the lot and wept."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I spied him cross the courtyard with  
A shudder and a smile -  
And every time I loosed my shiv,  
I thought of him a while.

*Of all the men, he stood unique,*  
*And I, his maiden fair -*  
*He'd be my hope, my heart, my reek -*  
*My mighty Greyjoy bear.*

And when I had my Iron boy;  
When love had stopped the clocks -  
I'd mutilate his pride and joy,  
And keep it in a box."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There, at ease, I watched in wonder,  
Skimpy wardrobe strewn asunder,  
Tempted by their perky plunder,  
Nobler thoughts at bay;

*Quite content to sit there, glancing,*  
*Watching sexy ladies dancing,*  
*Till it was a shape advancing*  
*Came my wayward way;*

There she stood with beauty rarer   
Than a fallen angel's, fairer...  
'Dad, it's me - your daughter, Sarah.  
Now I strip for pay.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"From dusk to dawn, across the land,  
Where shapes and shades of shadows stand  
In silent, still, penumbra light -  
Its silhouette appears at night.

*It sniffs the air and takes the scent -*  
*That figure formed in malcontent,*  
*And forged from foul, repugnant parts -*  
*It hunkers down; its music starts.*

You hear its soft euphonic cries;  
Its quiet grunts and eerie sighs.  
It stops.  
It shifts.  
It shakes, and then...  
The Phantom Pooper strikes again.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"The playground air was cool and still  
That morning in the Fall -  
But all the same there seemed a chill,  
Though nothing stirred at all.

*The Thesps discussed their art.*  
*The Emos scratched their arms and cried.*  
*The Loners stood apart.*  

The Jocks had joked. The Prayer-Kids prayed.  
The Scenesters took the flank.  
The Goths emerged from out the shade,  
And gathered round in rank.

*They stood, in groups and gangs, in place;*  
*Apart - in No Man's Land.*  
*A look of hate on every face;*

*Old Testament* in here.'"

*And trident aimed at every ship,*  
*He simply slept: he'd lost his grip.*

Where boats had sunk to early graves  
From pulverising winter waves  
Bestirred from old Poseidon's hand,  
He never moved; they reached the land.

*Then sighed aloud and shook his head.*  
*'The boss has changed; this job, I mean...*  
*I'm sick of kissing assholes clean!'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Beside a station stop at night -  
The season, frozen cold -  
A crowd drew up beneath the light,  
To hear a story told:

*'They say he came from Illinois -*  
*The trav'llin' man, I mean.*  
*The wanderer - the gypsy boy;*  
*The rollin' ramblin' teen.*

He packed his bags one lonesome day,  
With leavin' on his mind -  
Then stepped his own wayfairin' way,  
Without a glance behind.

*They say, with just the clothes he wore,*  
*He travelled every track;*  
*A million miles or maybe more,*  
*And never lookin' back...'*

A shape emerged and shook its head;  
'That man - the tracks he crossed?  
That's *me*. I fell asleep,' he said.
  
'... I'm really fucking lost.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'That isn't true for me, but you -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I have a plan,' so spoke the man,  
'To change the span of time's domain!  
A game of joy; the perfect ploy  
To damned destroy that fascist's reign!'

*'Oh yes?' said I, with weary sigh,*  
*And rolling eye: 'That's good to hear.*  
*But have you thought (perhaps you ought) -*  
*You're kinda fraught with crazy, dear?'*

'A *spud*!' he said. 'Inside his head  
To make him dead and take his place!'  
'... that's pretty weird.'  

He stroked his beard...  

Then disappeared without a trace!"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Within the sight of younger skies  
And aeons ages passed;  
To stranger calls and bygone cries  
From mighty mammoths vast; 

*Beside an early summer's breeze*  
*That stirred an ancient ground;*  
*Amidst a clearing nearest trees*  
*Where cavemen gathered round;*

Beneath the timeless glow of stars  
In darkest shade of nights -  
It stood in arms, that man from Mars...  

'*Eat laser, troglodytes*!'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I sometimes think I see his face -  
The man without a voice.  
The man who walks another place,  
Divided by a choice.

*Perhaps he never made the same*  
*Mistakes across the years -*  
*He never felt an addict's shame*  
*In broken pride and tears.*

Perhaps he wed the perfect wife,  
And sailed across the sea.  
Perhaps he led a better life.  
Who cares?

He isn't *me*."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'No matter what the chances are -

*A picnic picked for every day,*  
*With feasts all fit for kings!'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'What will the future look like, son?'  
My father said to me.  
'When all these days are passed and done,  
What will you want to be?

*And green beret by night?*  
*A physicist to lead the way*

The orders from above?  
A chance to change? A chance to turn  
For armistice and love?

*'Just here,' I said...*  
*'I hope.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'What's your handle, darling dearest?'  
So I asked, intrigued to find  
All his posts, and so the nearest  
'Evidence' he'd left behind.

*There I'd see his secret passions -*  
*Lusts and loves and hopes and dreams;*  
*Ladies wrapped in scanty-fashions,*  
*Bursting at their shapely seams.*

Maybe he'd have dropped his dentures  
For a man of 'wit' and 'whim' -  
Telling tales of false adventures  
Through some self-made pseudonym.

*Maybe he - to acclamation,*  
*Votes and gildings by the tons -*  
*Formed the stuff of adulation,*  
*Posting gifs and pics and puns.*

Thus, with merry disposition,  
So it was I took a look.  
There it sat, his 'top' submission:  
'Here's my cumbox.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Although my girlfriend's unaware -   
Or doesn't seem at all to care

I think she ought to get a grip.

*She never tries to understand,*

*And think, though few in truth compete -*  
*In this, at least, I've got her beat.*

'Just think!' I say, 'and think it through!  
I'll offer up a hand or two,  
And more besides, so what's the harm?  
I've years of skill in every palm!'

*'It's hard,' she says, 'oh can't you see?'*  
*I say: 'I know - you're telling me.*  
*But you, you're made of stronger stuff,*  
*And tests are good, and this one's tough.*

I'll show you round the bends and twists

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Beneath a spinning fan above -  
Upon a leather seat -

And memories, bittersweet.

*'My class was cliques, and no one cared -*

The shame to leave it all behind.  
I laughed, that is, until the day

In time, it bent and curved and bowed,  
Defeated by the weight.

*A table's made for keys, it seems,*  
*And other sundries, small -*  
*But not for love and hope or dreams -*  
*And not for life at all.*

There's not a one across the Earth -  
I told him from the start -  
Could ever hold, for what it's worth,  
A broken home and heart.

*And so it broke - no more to bear*  
*The burden, tied and chained -*  
*For everything he'd emptied there*  
*Was his, and so remained.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I walked to work in endless shame  
While others crossed the street behind,  
And shook their heads; they cursed my name  
With words that echoed 'round my mind.

*I heard them whisper 'sinner', 'beast',*  
*With every step I sadly took -*  
*And every day their hate increased*  
*With every bitter, spiteful look.*

With silent tears, and thoughts that pricked  
My heart till all the hope was gone -  
I stood alone, with apples picked...  
And stuck the little stickers on.'
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Ensnared in amber clouds of flame  
That burned and screamed as thunder fell,  
Was *Lucifer*, in endless shame  
And pain, forsaken, bound for Hell.

*The Father's Hand had thrust him out -*  
*And there, as from a dream, he woke*  
*To obloquy; to fear and doubt*  
*In darkest shades of fire and smoke.*

He lay apart, alone, and wept  
For love and loss; for dice he'd cast,  
While Man, naive and trusting, slept  
Oblivious to what had passed. 

*And still, in time, he raged at plight*  
*Unwarranted - unjust, unfair.*  
*He learned to love the boundless night,*  
*And planned revenge, for Man's despair.*
  
When years had passed, and finally free  
To make the play he'd planned so long,  
He stood and laughed, at last, in glee...  
And squeezed the toothpaste tube all wrong. "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Oh what a lovely crossbow dear!  
A lovely crossbow thing!  
A lovely crossy crossbow here,  
But where's its crossbow string?  

*I ache to see an arrow fly*  
*From off that crossbow's bow!*  
*Oh won't you put it back and try?'*  
*She asked. I answered...*

'No.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'So long,' said he, from high above,  
With glass in hand, and hand in glove  
Of whitest felt to swirl the grape  
Of Southern France - our mouths, agape.  

'But first', he said, 'before you go  
I really feel you ought to know:  
A finer glass (*to interrupt*)  
Than that of which you've lately supped,  
Exists to cleanse the pallet pure -  
And though the year you tried, I'm sure,  
Was sugar-sweet as honey mead  
(A vintage rather fair indeed),  
I'd say, for such a savoury dish,  
You'd really need a wine for *fish* -  
Perhaps a pinot, chardonnay,  
Or something dry from Monterey?  
A sauvignon? A sparkling wine  
For flavours matching tastes divine?'

And so he laughed.  

The air was still.  

No sounds escaped my lips until,  
I watched him stroke his pencil-beard,  
And said... 'your cousin's fucking weird.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Before it struck, I had a while  
In pre-repentance bliss  
To contemplate, with half a smile,  
The things that led to this.

*Vociferous from year to year,*  
*I'd always been the same -*  
*And so I watched it freewheel near*  
*And knew just who to blame.*

'You might have done,' (I'd made my stance  
Too quick, if truth be told),  
'If maybe you'd have had a chance  
And weren't so fucking old!'

*It spun and flew, and far.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'With all the petty, spiteful glee  
Of childishness and youth,  
I treated people awfully -  
And that's the honest truth.

*I willied every waiting ear -*  
*I thumb-tacked every seat.*  
*I twisted arms from there to here,*  
*And wedgied with repeat.*

I spitballed every easy eye -  
I swirlied every head.  
I laughed to see an infant cry  
With every word I said.

*But listen close - on days like these,*  
*I've only my regret.*  
*For now they've wives and families...*  
*And I've the internet.*'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Dearest son,' she started saying,

When the poor and paupers, braying,  
Walk their bankrupt, beggar's walk -

*Simply greet and shoo them, sweetest -*  
*Cut the chaff, and shun the poor.*  
*Should they carp and cry 'elitist',*  
*Share a smile - and nothing more.*

When some perfect pauper's whelp  
Comes to you for aid or kindness...  
Never, *ever*, help the help.'"

The finest, flawless, feline pet?  
Oh, Fluffy... it ain't you.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Her dress was rose and cream, and caught  
The light - and eyes of men.  
She'd worn it once for me, I thought -  
But never had again.

*I stood behind the window frame,*  
*And saw in every smile*  
*A tune I'd known, and shared the same -*  
*If only for a while.*

She'd pick a soul to lead astray -  
To string upon a song.  
*Good luck*, I thought, and turned away...  
*She's never yours for long*."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The saber shone and spun with speed,  
Until - a blur of shining steel -  
It stopped before the noble steed,  
Which raised its head, and bent to kneel.

*And sheathed his sword; he wiped his brow,*  
*And looked toward his horse with pride...*  
*Until it stretched, and neighed: 'meow'*"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'A tissue's fine - if you've the time,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'So listen, right - I've found these plates, you see.  
An angel showed me where they lay,  
In eighteen-twenty-three.  
They're scribed in *solid gold*, I'll have you know -

From *very* long ago.

*A rock, that is, that shows the truth*  
*To me... and me alone.*  
*I place it in a hat, and put it on -*  
*And then I face the plates, forsooth,*

What's that, you say? A *charlatan*? A hack!?  
You want the *plates*? I'd love to, but...  
The angel took them back.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"There I wandered, poor and waiting,  
Lost in thought and contemplating  
Childish life while sadly rating  
Games I'd never own -

*Whereupon I saw in wonder*  
*Someone's foolish, pricey blunder -*  
*Rolls of twenties fallen under*  
*Shelves - and left, unknown!*

So it was I pondered, sighing,   
All the games that I'd be buying -  
Till I came across her crying,  
Sad - and gave a groan.

*'Yes,' she smiled, the truth discerning...*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I'm here!' I said, and pushed the door,  
With roses picked and plucked for her -  
That dropped beside the bedroom floor,  
Forgotten fast... for there they were.

*They groped and rolled and squeezed and rode,*  
*All rosy-cheeked, with groans and sighs,*  
*That peaked and paled, or sped and slowed*

And quiet as the grave -  
I wandered down the hall until,

I felt a fleeting, frozen chill  
That rode upon a wave.

And there - beside my bedroom door  
In PJ's, barely robed -  
I slipped to where I'd been before;  
A seamless seven feet or more.  
My thoughts were thick.  

My ass was sore.

*She's unprepared. The screaming starts.*  
*She never calls again.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*'There's not a single thing on Earth -*  
*No circumstance, for what it's worth -*  
*Nor simple, honest act of love*  
*In life, or under stars above,*

*A perfect act; a flawless thing.*  

*For nothing sweeter, friends, exists...*  
*Than tiny babies bumping fists.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I glanced ahead and held the door;  
His beard was long and white!  
I ogled at the suit he wore -  
He made a jolly sight.

*'You first,' I said, and stayed behind*  
*To hold it open yet -*  
*'My thanks,' he spoke, 'that's very kind,*  
*My friend - I won't forget.'*

I bid the man a fond goodbye -  
He smiled and turned to go.  
But as he left, I heard him sigh:  
'So long,' and '... ho, ^ho, ^^ho.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The sheriff swung his head and swore:  
'It's just a damned disgrace!  
We'll ask Detective Steve, next door.  
I'm sure he's on the case!'

He strode away indignant - shocked,  
And cried: 'He'll take a look!  
We'll have it solved!' he called, and knocked;  
'Hey Steve! It's... *what the fuck*?!'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"An adage for the modern employee:

'You're only a measure for getting ahead -  
They use you, abuse you, and leave you for dead.  
They feed on you, needing you, bleed you for more,  
Or squeeze till you're empty, then show you the door.

*They chain you with half-spoken promises, yet -*  
*You're not irreplaceable, never forget.*  
*You're only a puppet, when all's said and done.*  
*You're plucked, and you're fucked.*  

*You're the golden goose, son.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Translation:

'I made a hat from prison, friend,  
For this - your special day!  
A birthday cap, with poem penned  
To wish the best, and say:

*Your presents - theirs to give!*  
*But if they laugh or mock your hat...*  
*Then use it as a shiv.'*

Happy new year, all!"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When years have travelled, swift or slow,  
And life has changed for all, at last,  
I hope they think on us, and know  
How good it is our age has passed.

*They'll never hear the news, dismayed*  
*To find it's not their time, or give*  
*A moment's thought to that, afraid*  
*To wait... and wait... and hope to live.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'*File it all!*' she ordered, squinting,  
Heedless to our help and hinting -  
Till, at last, the thought of printing  
Filled us all with dread.

*Every message work-related:*  
*Print and bound and replicated;*  
*Marked and filed and logged and dated,*  
*Ready to be read.*

Then, one day, we ceased compiling -  
Turned our printers off, and smiling,  
Hugged 'round heaps of flaming filing.  
'*Stop*,' they'd said, '... she's dead.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"His smile was huge. His teeth were white.  
His suit was red, with buttons bright.  
His beard was freshly fallen snow.  
His hat was long; his eyes aglo.

*'AND WHO,' he grinned and asked, 'ARE YOU?'*  
*Then boomed a mighty 'ho', or two,*  
*And gave a holly, jolly sigh -*  
*'It's us,' we said, 'it's reddit. Hi.'*

The laughing stopped.  
The smiles were done.  
'THAT'S IT!' he cried, 'YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN!  
YOU NAUGHTY SITE! YOUR DAYS ARE THROUGH!  
NO GIFTS AT ALL! NO SAFE FOR YOU!'

*And then - before a moment more -*  
*He ripped the hinges off the door!*  
*He took it all, then turned to go,*  
*And cried... 'TILL NEXT YEAR! HO-HO-HO!'*

:(

TL;DR:  
*They opened up the safe for all*  
*With hope and joy, it seems...*  
*And found it empty, wall to wall,*  
*But full of broken dreams.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I woke alone at night in chains  
Of shining steel and weighted rings  
That hung from high in swollen veins,  
Or twist and caught like tattered wings.

*I knew the smell - the stench of death*  
*That rose and grew as vision blurred*  
*With every painful, broken breath,*  
*Until - at last - a shadow stirred.*

It stretched a pointed, stunted limb  
That held a sharpened shape. A sigh.  
A sound. A voice. A whisper, grim:  
'*You'll cross your heart and hope to die...*'"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Though others pondered sex in youth  
With childish thoughts and doubts,  
I never misconceived the truth -  
I knew its 'ins' and 'outs'.  

*I'd read on every point-of-view*  
*(As often as I dared);*  
*I'd wandered every avenue,*  
*And thought myself prepared.*  

And yet - despite these hopes and dreams  
As childhood passed me by -  
I'd presupposed a fact, it seems...  
And thought I'd get to try."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I've heard them say I'm full of wit  
And whim, and fair of face;  
The perfect blend, they all admit,  
Of intellect and grace.

*I've mastered love and style and tact;*  
*I ooze the debonair.*  
*I've everything I need, in fact -*  
*Except the perfect pair.*

For though I've all I want it seems,  
I curse (in private rants)  
The bitter truth - my foolish dreams...  
Of men in yoga-pants."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I made a world from thought alone...  
But that was then - for now I'm grown,  
I hardly ever think of lands  
Where sailors sail on golden sands,  
Or pirates 'cross the seven seas  
To dig for long-forgotten keys  
That opened chests to treasures old,  
Or mountains high and caverns cold.  

*I leave my room with keys to work -*  
*To duties that I cannot shirk.*  
*I work each day with thoughts in mind*  
*Of bills to pay, and cash to find.*  
*I pay the bills, and trudge toward*  
*A house I know I can't afford.*  
*I go to sleep, exhausted, quick...*  
*And dream about the perfect stick.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He gagged and hurled a retching heave  
Of blended bile and food:  
'You can't...' he cried, 'I can't believe  
You... *did you?!* Did you, dude?'

*He'd said enough. I shook my head,*  
*Our friendship likely done.*  
*'I did,' I sighed, and sadly said...*  
*'I shit myself for fun.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"His cheeks had had their final fill;  
He'd gnawed and nipped his last.  
His wheel had turned; the cage was still...  
When Hammy Hamster passed.

*I didn't mope. I didn't cry -*  
*Nor weep, or moan, and bawl.*  
*I didn't grieve, or say 'goodbye'...*  
*I didn't know at all.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'My dear, you know I’d never try  
To stop what’s only right –  
You've got your needs, and so do I',  
She said, to my delight.

*'I've always said,' I heard her say,*  
*'On-line, you're free to roam...*  
*But maybe put your cock away,*  
*And wait till we get home.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It... *sat*. As though a blackened stew  
Of spit and spew with rancid core  
Had fastened to his skull with glue -  
Or will alone, and nothing more.

*It sat... and stank, like rotted fruits,*  
*Or cankers rank that festered there*  
*Through swamps of crawling, broken roots,*  
*In tangled webs of greasy hair.*

It sat... and pooled in heaps and twists  
That curled and looped as though to snatch  
And drag beneath its sores and cysts  
To drown in ooze - to feed; to catch.

*It sat... and stared. And watched the blade,*  
*As if to say: 'And* what? *Admit*  
*I'm potent babe', and writhed and swayed*  
*And mocked its prey...*

... 'I fucking quit.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I thought that courage lay, as youth,  
In story-books alone, and dreams  
Of shining knights and fabled truth...  
Until I grew, for now it seems:

*A man can pass through life afraid*  
*To stand for right and wrong; to see*  
*With apathetic eyes, and fade...*  
*While others fashion history.*

This seems like a good place to speak (so to speak) out of verse for the first time in the year and a half since I started this account. 

It's something of an understatement, I know, but this really is a loss for humanity. I remember being bought a book of inspirational speeches by a well-meaning uncle for Christmas about fifteen years ago and, though disappointed not to have received the second 'Harry Potter', slowly reading Nelson Mandela's address to the court during his trial while my family watched re-runs of Wallace and Gromit movies. As distracting as that scene might seem, I can still remember the feeling I had as - with silent chills and utter respect - I read over the last of his closing lines:

&gt;'I have cherished the ideal of a free society in which people can live together in harmony and equality. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.'

Even now, I can't recall the moment without *that* feeling in my chest. You know the one.

Forgive any mistakes above - I'm quoting from memory as best as I can.

All the very best.

Sprog.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"On distant lands where futures die  
And shadows lie as black as coal,  
I've walked the sands beneath a sky  
Where tempests cry and tear the soul.

*They speak it there, where legends dwell*  
*Of those who fell before me, brave...*  
*For few compare to when they tell*  
*My tale: 'Excel, without a save.'*
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"In dead of night, I dream alone  
Of cries and haunted shrieks -  
The sigh of ghosts; an eerie groan.  
I wake... the darkness creaks.  

*With rising dread, I fear the source,*  
*And wait, aghast, for more -*  
*But nothing ever comes, of course,*  
*Exactly as before.*

I curse my over-active mind.  
The tension ebbs and slacks.  

A closer *creak*, and more behind...  

'It's just the house. *Rela-*.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*Her neck was long and slender, pure*  
*As fallen snow; a lover's laugh;*  
*And perfect end to end, I'm sure...*  
*But unmistakably giraffe.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I asked to have them back and flashed  
A humble smile, ashamed, abashed -  
A mix of rue, regret, and woe  
(That found its mark). She let them go.

*'But really dear! You should have said!'*  
*She closed her eyes and shook her head.*  
*'An awful thing. A tragic day.*  
*A building blaze? For court you say?'*

A moment passed. She sighed and frowned,  
'Just wait till word of this gets round!'  
I shared her disapproving view,  
And thought... 'I'll have to burn her too.'
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I closed the door and turned away,  
Then thought I'd likely left behind  
A dozen things I'd need today...  
Though nothing ever springs to mind.

*I'd packed some clothes. I'd locked the door.*  
*I'd checked the presents: wrapped and brought.*  
*I'd cleaned the fridge and mopped the floor,*  
*And thought, I think, of all I ought.*
 
And yet, the thought persisted small -  
Until I knew, with sombre smile,  
I wasn't going home at all...  
But only visiting a while."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I heard in Transylvania  
A legend known to few -  
A shroud of myth and mania,  
As twisted as a screw.

*(A castle stands alone at height*  
*Above a dusky town -*  
*A crack of thunder splits the night;*  
*A rain comes rolling down.)*

The village people knew the truth -  
The damned, disturbed, depraved;  
Their mothers told them tales in youth  
To keep them well behaved.

*(At midnight, breezes blow and sigh;*  
*A storm begins to stir -*  
*The thunder rolls; the tempests cry*  
*For aeons lost; for her.)*

And so I sleep and hear it yet,  
When shadows prowl and lurk -  
The voice... that *laugh*... I can't forget...  
Count Cockula at work.

*(... 'One!)*  
*(... Two!)*  
*(... THREE...')*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I loved her with the purity  
And innocence of youth -  
Immune to insecurity;  
To fear and doubt - to truth.

*And fucked the fucking lot.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'In periwinkle rows of stone,  
They stood, and each apart -

*A thousand tears were cried...*  
*They say he passed the million mark*  
*While others drudged and died.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Their breaths were small and shallow, hushed,  
With every touch that skimmed and brushed  
Another, rosy-skinned and flushed,  
And lost within a lover's art,  
Until, when every moment rushed,  
They stilled and lay apart.

*He heard her sigh from 'cross the bed;*  
*Her eyes were blue; her lips were red,*  
*And pouted when he shook his head.*  
*'But how?' she asked, in tones of doubt,*  
*Until, at last, he smiled and said:*  
*'Like so,'... and ripped them out.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I woke alone in underwear  
All covered in his scent;  
And though I didn't find him there,  
I didn't fret; I didn't care -  
I didn't mope or moan, despair -  
He'd been the perfect gent.

*And so I left - but not before*  
*I'd heard a friendly shout;*  
*His aide had opened up a door*

*To say: 'They're yours! ... get out.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I've waited up all night,' she cried,  
And rubbed her aching head -

*In air of sudden ice.*  
*Her eyes were wide. She swallowed deep,*  
*And said... 'Okay. That's nice.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Behind the stage I sat in fear -  
The end had come; the hour was near.  
I read my lines and cursed it all -  
The stupid play; the southern drawl.

*A curtain twitched, and there he stood:*  
*'There's no one here! I'm done for good!'*  
*I heaved a sympathetic sigh,*  
*Then smiled and said... 'Thank God. Goodbye'.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'He's nice to kids!' my sister said,  
'The perfect man of dreams!'

'Oh what I wouldn't do to spend  
A moment in his arms!'  
*But that was then - before the end,*

'A guy like him must really care!'  
She spoke with pride and preened...  
*A word of warning, friends - beware*  
*The philanthropic fiend.*"

Sharpened bolts of pain unending -  
Vision fading; dark descending

*She asked with cheer,*

Her friend replied,

To lead a simple life -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"If I awoke and found the change,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"They offered up a friendly smile,  
And said: 'You're awful sweet

Poem_for_your_sprog,"A lipstick world of powder pink,  
I thought, in foolish pride -  
Of beads and bracelets, link to link;  
Of secrets she'd confide.

*I dreamt of dolls and dresses made*  
*In lace of perfect white;*  
*Of innocence; of hair to braid;*  
*Of purity and light.*

I fantasised a world, it seems,  
Of womanhood and whim -  
But found it nothing more than dreams...  
'Cos girls are fucking grim."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Surfing reddit, nearly napping,  
Bleary-eyed and yawning, tapping

*Peering close in trepidation,*  
*Dazed by what I saw -*

'What the fuck?' I cried in wonder,  
Delectation torn asunder -  
Screaming to the sound of thunder,  
Shaken to the core..."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Beneath the bitter light of day,  
I splashed and called her name -  
She looked at me, then turned away  
And hung her head in shame. 

*The others stared and gathered 'round*  
*As darkness came to creep -*  
*They watched me as I screamed and drowned*  
*In waters three-foot deep.*

I begged for help a final time  
Before I faced the black;  
And heard, at last, a sound sublime -  
A single, fearless... '*quack*'.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'See how it hunts at a medium pace -  
Marvellous creature! The first of its kind!  
Look as it gradually offers the chase -  
Leaving ('bout half of) the others behind.  

*There! 'Neath the sun of an African day -*  
*Standing as still as a waterless sea!*  
*Patient for hours to capture its prey -*  
*Sitting there silent... and stalking a tree.*

Watch as it climbs with its claws to a bough

Laugh at the marvel of nature, and now -  
Count yourself lucky to see it, my friend.

*Sloth and a cheetah, so graceful and slick;*  
*Sleek as a puma, and fast as a brick.*'  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"They waited together outside in the hall;  
The teacher was coming - he'd answered their call.

'An ice-cream float, some pumpkin pie?

Poem_for_your_sprog,"We fought in silver arms and made  
A shining blur of steel -  
The flowered knight withdrew his blade

*'That's it! I'm done. You've won,' he said...*  
*And pissed across my face.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He stood alone. 

The water flowed  
A shade of crimson red -

Just fucking answer, Steve.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I remember endless aching  
Timeless nights spent sleepless, taking  
Anything to stop the shaking,  
Anything I'd found -

*Thinking nothing - feeling hollow,*

*Stolen; hidden; downed.*

I remember darkness creeping  
Up and out and sinking, seeping,  
Crying in the night and sleeping,  
Lost without a sound.

*Sunlight most of every morning...*  
*Glad to be around.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Our genders match in terms of strife -

We're subject both to broken hearts,

Finally, he shook and, jerking,  
Finished up (and finished shirking) -  
'Working hard or hardly working,  
Huh?'... I said to me."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Now clear your plate', my mother frowned,  
'And don't you make a fuss -  
There's starving kids the world around  
Not half as blessed as us!'

I grumbled that it wasn't fair  
With every bitter chew;  
It *couldn't* be that awful there -  
They had Nintendo too."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"You're told it rose from out the ground;  
A silhouette without a sound -  
The boarded frames, the blackened door;  
The night a pitch of darker more.

*You heard it's only there below*  
*The crescent moon, the waning glow -*  
*It's shadow-wrought and darkness-made*  
*In atrament; from dusk and shade.*

You'll pray you never see it rise  
From out the night before your eyes -  
The raven halls, that fateful eve;  
The door's ajar. You never leave.
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I'm pretty much desensitised  
To misery and pain -  
I rarely find myself surprised  
By actions inhumane.

*It's easy to be weary when*  
*There's much to justify*  
*Misanthropy - and now and then,*  
*To breathe a cynic's sigh.*

And yet, despite it all, I'm cursed,  
It seems, and life's perverse -  
For when I think I've seen the worst,  
There's always something worse..."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I caught her in the alleyway  
Where no one else could see -  
'It's that or this,' she heard me say,  
'So what's it gonna be?'

*In dead of night, she turned her head;*  
*Her face a mask of strife -*  
*She looked between my hands and said...*  
*'Erm, yeah - I'll take the knife.'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'There's not a lot on Earth, in truth,  
So pleasing to the ear -  
No summer's sonnet sung in youth

No lady fair, or man,  
Could hope to tear my world apart...  
Except for *Unidan.*'
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Dear world, I guess I sort of find  
It pretty damn absurd  
To write with no one kind in mind  
For this - my final word.

*I've lived a life of fear and blame*  
*With every heart I'd break -*  
*I've caused a world of hurt and shame*

I wish that I could take it back...  
And *kudos* to that kid.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Though some men wish for love and wealth  
Or women, fast and free;

*For nothing beats (for what it's worth)*  
*A crayon and a wall.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'What's this?' he asked. His smile was wide,  
And cold as winter days.  
'A s- a sandwich,' I replied,  
'Just tuna mayonnaise.'

*I recognised the pleasant sound -*  
*The voice, all cool and warm;*  
*And knew, afraid again, I'd found*  
*The calm before the storm.*  

'I see', he spoke, and raised his head  
To stare into my eyes;  
'Just mayonnaise,' my husband said,  
'Oh darling, so unwise.'

*... The sirens sounded through the air;*  
*The neighbours coalesced.*  
*I'd disappeared - but he was there,*  
*And drowned in Hellman's best.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I spied her there outside the house -  
She waved an arm and gave a call;  
'You want a snack,' she asked, 'or mouse?  
A dish of milk? A cotton ball?'

*The loving voice; the selfless deed -*  
*I never could have known she'd planned*  
*A human-feline centipede...*"

Your program for the day -  
A speech on man's equality

*You've immigrants to scorn and shun,*  
*And women, condescend.*

You've feminists to victimise;  
Abortion to deny;  
The nation's health to compromise  
With each alarmist lie.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"The middle stall was occupied -  
The left without a door.  
I took the right and slipped inside  
To face what lay in store.

*A puddle shone inside the stall*  
*Where flies had come to drown;*  
*I watched them die, and worst of all -*  
*The toilet lid was down.*  

My hands went out in search of roll,  
But found the empty space -  
A shudder shook my very soul;  
A tear rolled down my face.

*Yet there I was, and this was it;*  
*I flipped the lid in dread -*  
*A brown leviathan of shit*

I said: 'it's cool - I'll wait.'"

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'So don't forget,' she smiled and said,  
'Your grandma's here tonight.'  
Her words resounded 'round my head -

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I dreamt about it every night,

The reckoning, the final fight;  
The sudden, awful shame.

*To cash that fabled cheque,*  
*I whispered from behind his name...*  
*And stabbed him in the neck.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"He sat across the aisle and stared  
With pride, it seemed, and manhood bared  
For all to see, had someone dared  
To pass a glance along.

*I breathed a single sigh and said,*    
*'You're doing it all wrong.'*  "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"My head was full of hopes and dreams -  
My heart was beating fast;  
My smile was bursting at the seams,  
And grew as seconds passed.

*I waited by the popcorn stand,*  
*And smoothed my favourite dress -*  
*'Oh, this old thing?' I'd say offhand,*  
*Impatient to impress.*

And when, at last, he came to sit  
(I'd dreamt about the day)...  
He said 'hello' and talked a bit  
Then walked the fuck away."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I saw her there beneath a sky  
The shade of darkest midnight's hue;  
A noted tale - the lover by  
The river standing stalwart true.

*I'd heard she'd met a stranger fair*

*The man that leaves without a care*  
*In infamy won't oft return.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young, I made a list  
To do before I die -  
To start a star-crossed lovers' tryst;  
To sail across the sky.

*I thought to ride an ocean's waves*  
*Through every storm and tide;*  
*I'd walk the deepest, darkest caves*  
*With bravery and pride.*

And when (at last) the moment came  
To fill my final wish,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Who cares?' she said, and smiled a smile  
A harpy from the days of yore  
Could practice to its friends a while

*And pain that raged within, and found*  
*A sudden calm descend again.*

'I really fucking hope that's true.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"My friends all laugh and call me cheap

Acronyms and fair expressions,  
Singular to fine professions...

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I saw her on the playground there -  
Apart, amidst the trees;  
She sat alone with auburn hair  
That drifted in the breeze.

*Her eyes had tracked a fallen leaf*  
*That passed her lonely place -*  
*And gods, I couldn't bear the grief*  
*Or sadness on her face.*

'What's wrong?' I asked, afraid to hear  
Her answer then, in truth;  
Afraid her words might rob the cheer  
Of innocence and youth.

*And so she turned, as though a dread*  
*That no one understood*    
*Had left her numb, until she said...*

'Not me - at all - but *you*.'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Her words were harsh and cold as ice -  
An empty bitter pain;  
I'd close my eyes and still they'd slice

*He said, 'it's what you're 'bout to do!'* 

I paused, perplexed, amidst his squad,  
And said: 'though no one's hurt or harmed,  
You're here for me? That's kinda odd.'  
He scratched his head and looked alarmed.

*And while they stood confused and then*

*And stabbed as many as I could.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I bought myself some lingerie -  
A sexy little piece  
With frills and tassels that display  
The nipples on release - 

*A pair of crotchless underwear;*  
*Suspenders made of lace;*  
*Some melting wax to shave the hair*  
*From all but off my face -*

I bought a corset made of string,  
And boots of crimson red;  
A whip and cuffs and everything  
To please a man in bed!

*The sexy potpourri,*  
*She asked: 'your wife?', and I replied:*  
*'No darling... just for me.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It's such a rather simple thing -  
A moment's work, in fact;  
A pause amidst the grind and fling  
Of lovers in the act -

*And sure, we might complain as youth:*  
*'It doesn't feel the same' -*  
*But isn't that preferred in truth*  
*To syphilitic shame?*  

(For gonorrhoea blows, my friend,  
And yeasts with fungal spore -  
That itch like hell at either end -  
Aren't easy to ignore;)

*With every sketch and every style*  
*They carried off, I thought a while*  
*And it occurred to me -*

Not one of them could quite surpass  
The man they call Mochrie.

'... you're five. Go back to bed.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"They say that chivalry is dead -  
A foolish moral of the youth

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young and lost in thought

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I've travelled all the world around

I heard a voice from close behind  
Grunt: 'Hulk smash puny human... *dad*.'"

A stirring in my underpants...

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Twas midnight and the streets were dark  
As blackest pits of purest shade  
In Rome, where alleyways were stark  
And not a single sound was made;

*I stalked my prey in dead of night*  
*Who walked alone (except for me),*  
*And slid behind just out of sight*  
*As his unbidden company;*

And when at last, to his surprise,  
I grabbed his wallet unprepared,  
I saw the eyes - *dear god, the eyes* -  
That fluttered to the ground and stared;

*And as I ran, I heard him scream*  
*'No matter where you go, you'll see*  
*Through every day and waking dream...*  
*My wallet looking out for me.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The moon was high, and in the night  
Outside the winds were howling doom,

*I tried my best to understand,*  
*Until a sigh escaped my lungs*  
*And stopped the sentence he had planned;*

I said: 'My friend, I'll contemplate  
Your thoughts again some other eve -  
For now the hour has grown too late...  
And man, I really wish you'd leave.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"In dead of night with bated breath  
And pallid in the gloom,  
I climbed the stairs and hoped for death  
Before I faced my doom;

*The candlelight shone out their door*  
*And flickered in the hall -*  
*And in the dark, I sobbed and saw*  
*Their shadows on the wall;*

I heard their awful, anguished throes  
And feared to comprehend -  
And all, dear god, because I chose  
The path to make it end."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"My father taught me how to live  
Without a hope, and how to give  
A kid he didn't care about  
A life of shame and fear and doubt;

*He taught me how to miss a guy*  
*You never knew, and wonder why*  
*He couldn't find a way to say*  
*You weren't enough for him to stay;*

He taught me how to never call,  
And how to hurt, but most of all -  
My father's lessons showed to me  
The dad I didn't want to be."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Oh, I rather think it splendid  
That, with disbelief suspended,

How it really was intended."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Through every town and every street -

*And I upvoted that.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I should have said 'I told you so',  
Or some cruel piece of repartee -  
To show them that they're quite below  
My undisputed mastery;

*Or maybe made a quick retort*  
*And put their argument to shame;*  
*Then mustered up some perfect thought,*  
*Or trusted uncontested claim;*

And if I couldn't bring him 'round

I should have punched him to the ground  
And kicked him in his stupid face.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"We laughed throughout the 'trail of tears'

It's always fucking *Chad*."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'Twas midnight 'midst the city streets

*Beyond the faculty of men -*  
*I watched in fear, and for a while*  
*He didn't stir or move again.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"In shady hues of dusky night,  
The solemn orange amber rays

*They trade a file and one man leaves*  
*With half a smile that no one sees.*

The other sighs and nods his head -

We talked beneath the fading sun  
As twilight turned to night.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When my knee had needed mending

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Golden roses lit the night air;  
Burnt the land and boiled the sea -  
So it seemed amidst the nightmare  
Battle of Serenity.

*

Years will pass and men'll seek boats  
Sailing to a thousand parts -  
Colours fade from scars and brown-coats  
Over time, but not from hearts.

*

Shepherds search for their salvation;  
Brothers look to family;  
Some have pay for motivation;  
Others live for being *free*.

*

So it is we join the firefly  
As she sails without a sound  
Through some wind-swept distant night-sky,  
Bringing smuggled goods to ground.

First-mate Zoe, Wash and Kaylee,  
Simon, River, Book and Jayne;  
Risking death and perils daily  
'Cross the 'verse, to seek their gain.

*

'Cept... it seem's the war's returning -  
River's plight might end the crew:  
Haunted muttered words concerning...  
'Two-by-two; their hands are blue.'

And, no matter where they're going -  
What the worlds or fortune brings -  
Troubled winds are always blowing  
Round the firefly's broken wings.

Thus they look to their commander;  
To their captain, good and brave:  
Malcolm Reynolds' fight and candour -  
As he aims to misbehave...

*She walked around their home some more*

And yet, it worked out in the end  
For everyone (except my friend) -

The owners came... and they were bears!

Stop the clocks.

And I almost broke my spine."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"There's not a lyric on this Earth,  
Nor verse to end the grief;  
And still I'd try to rhyme some words,  
To offer you relief.

*Life is often fleeting, asking,*  
*For the highest debt;*  
*Taking what we love and leaving,*  
*Hoping we forget.*

So it is that we resist it,  
Through the toil and grime...  
Keeping memories, thoughts of touches,  
With us all the time.

*

Sincere condolences. "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"'That's it, I'm finally here', he thought,  
And clapped his hands in joyful glee;  
'Ten years of work (but not for naught),  
And all so that I'll finally see,  
What happened fifty years ago -  
The mysteries from decades past -  
And why Roswell, New Mexico,  
(To learn for good the truth at last.')

*And so, the President elect,*  
*Said 'hand the secret files to me';*  
*He sighed with sombre, deep respect,*  
*And spread the folder, just to see...*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"It's not the first black president;  
Nor the Iraqi war;  
It's not the fact that HIV,

*(Though he's missed all the same);*  
*It's not that Ben Affleck bounced back,*  
*To critical acclaim.*

No, rather there's another thing,  
That's harder to conceive -  
'Cos goddamn Snape killed Dumbledore,  
And *that* I won't believe."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*A poem for the long-distance redditors:*

*

When I’m feeling lost and sleeping,  
Floating through the stars at night;  
Thoughts unbidden, softly creeping,  
Whisper... ‘it will be all right’.

*So I dream of you and wonder,*   
*If I built a ship for me -*  
*Sailing through the foam and thunder,*  
*Would you kiss me ‘cross the sea?*

Maybe if I made an airplane,  
Only for your secret smile;  
Stowed aboard a midnight freight-train,  
Just to hold your hand a while;

*Then I needn’t dream with gladness,*  
*Of embraces, kisses slow;*  
*Just to wake alone in sadness,*  
*Thinking thoughts of you, and so:*

Know I always miss you dearly,  
Dreaming dreams of when you’ll be,  
Sleeping close and touching nearly,   
Sighing sweetly, next to me.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'You want to come 'round after school?'  
The question made me stop and smile -  
The kid was popular and cool,  
And so I said I'd hang a while.  

*We played on all his PC games,*  
*And stayed up late, 'til after dark;*  
*Then called each other stupid names,*

And every second seemed a thrill;  
I'd never made a friend before...  
And it was really awesome 'til,  
I had to kill his Labrador."

To free the shadows from the dark.

*I slowed the car and felt the chill,*  
*Of deepest night: of strangers' stare.*

And even now - though years have passed -

A thousand shadows darkly massed,

*The story of the death I'm owed;*  
*I'll say before my last farewell,*

Nostalgia faded; disappeared.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I sometimes spy with admiration;  
Questions rousing contemplation,

Read the thread in bliss:

*Then, of course, there's others seeking,*  
*'Colby', 'nachos'; this.*

So I read on, through threads fleeting;

'Cumbox' comments, yarns repeating...  
Tales of cash for piss."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I rubbed the lamp and out it shot,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Her image left its mark on me -  
A shaded beauty in the gloom;

*I praised my awesome flirting craft,*  
*And spent the night at her abode.*

And then - all over in a blur,

I stretched and turned my head to her...  
And wished to God that I was dead.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"She winked at me from 'cross the desk,

*

I remember reading comments,  
Through a thread dispersed;  
Laughing at their carefree stories,  
Innocent at first;  
When I came across a memoir,  
Of a midnight stroll;  
Lovers *meant* to be together;  
Two, with just one soul.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I remember softly swimming,

*'Help!' I called to a crustacean,*  
*As they dragged me by the ass.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It's sometimes hard to just forgive,  
The things done in the past.

An analyst and genius;  
The smartest of his day.  
But driven to an early grave...  
And why? 

*For being gay.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Golden sunlight washed the air plane,  
As we flew across the blue;  
Summer winds that sighed a warm rain,  
Swirled and blew around us two.

*Then, the crashing, wrenching slaughter;*  
*Engines stopped and fowlers cropped;*  
*So we sank towards the water,*  
*Spinning topped and stony-dropped.*

Liquid darkness, groaning galling,  
Cut-off cheer replaced by fear,  
As a voice came roughly calling...  
'Arr my dear, what have we here?'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"It's easy to be weary when,  
There's much to justify,  
A bitter view of fellow man,

*Has come to claim the debt,*  
*A stranger lends a helping hand...*  
*And we never forget.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I've lived a life of new exploits,  
And never shied away,  
From seeking opportunities,  
And chancing, come what may.

*And yet, despite experience -*  
*Adventures 'cross the map;*  
*I've found there's nothing quite as good,*  
*As taking time to nap.*

A lunch time snooze or forty winks;  
A dreaming, dribbled doze...  
Forget a life of awesome feats,  
And give me one of those.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I went to see a kids' movie,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"There's not much on this Earth at all,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Every time she rolls her eyes,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"That haunted, howling, monstrous sound;  
A rolling, rumbling, all around,

*Like a nightmare drawing nearer;*

Fiendish foe I can't disable...  
So I hide under a table,  
Whimpering in pee.

He said we'd have to take the bus,

'Cos Hogwarts' making cuts'."

I felt a little lost...

I couldn't work out what to do,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young I always thought,

(Despite what they had said),

My parents kept their wealth from me,

To buy them things instead.

*What's more, thought I, with deep disgust,*

A selfish little shit.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Despite I'll never understand,

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I walked the streets of Rome at dusk,

I fought a dragon in the snow;

I built a world of blocks...

Tonight I think I'll view the Vaults,

Then pick a few closed locks.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I shall tell you, if they let me -

*

Once upon a midnight dreary,  
Whilst I pondered late, eyes bleary,  
There I came up with a theory,  
Of a world at war:  
Aliens of evil races,  
Seeking battle 'cross the spaces,  
Came upon a thousand places,  
Where they might explore.  
(Taking worlds from native folks,  
But leaving nothing more).

*Faced with pure annihilation,*  
*Some poor thing from some lost nation,*  
*Left its home to dead stagnation,*  
*Seeking stars of lore.*  
*Decades later, left and stranded,*  
*Flying solo, single-handed,*  
*Engines failing, it crash-landed,*  
*On some foreign shore.*  
*(And surviving somehow still,*  
*Opened up the door.)*  

Thus I thought, my theory seeming,  
Nothing more than drunken dreaming,  
Looking up into a teeming,  
Night of stars galore.  
Then as though by clear commanding,  
Came a sudden thought-expanding,  
Truth explaining understanding:   
[CENSORED, NOTHING MORE.](/spoiler)

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I met her in the restaurant;

Our table pre-arranged.

We said hello and settled down,

Our pleasantries exchanged.

*She said, 'I'm havin- OH MY GOD!'*

*I fapped furiously.* "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was young I had a friend,  
Of seven, just like me.  
We'd play at fighter-pilot games,  
And pirates lost at sea.

*We'd dream of travelling the Earth,*  
*And swimming down the Nile;*  
*Of crossing plains and forests deep;*  
*Of walking every mile.*  

And though we grew (though not apart),  
He always stayed my friend;  
In stories friendships last for good...  
But all good things must end.  

*For minds stay young but men grow old,*  
*And pass before their fill;*  
*And still, I carry all our dreams,*  
*To take me where they will.*  

I'll see all of the world for him;  
I'll travel anywhere.  
A ticket each - just one for me;  
And him - a teddy bear."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"In life, sometimes a question needs,

An elegant reply;

A careful reasoned eloquence,

To please a reader's eye.

*To balance out the first;*

*Throughout the thread dispersed...*

Yet sometimes there's a comment here,

That simply ends the thread:

'Cos when your sister is your wife,

I think enough's been said."

*And space? Too early to be great.*
"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I've always said to all my friends,

And all my family;

'Sure, you suck at that right now,

But think how it could be!

*For if you practice day and night,*

*You're sure to find before too long,*

*You'll soon be... kinda good.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The context set; my parents out;

And I - sixteen and free;

My time had come (and so would I);

I waited patiently.

*I'd called them up an hour ago,*

*The moment almost here;*

*I checked myself once over as,*

*The sound of steps drew near.*

I heard a knock, and then a voice,

Call 'pizza'; nothing more.

I limbered up and set my pose,

Then threw open the door. 

*And there I stood, from head to toe,*

*As naked as could be...*

*And then, too late, I realised,* 

*That porn had lied to me.*

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I was younger mother said,

'No babe, you're not ugly;

And I'll love you, for always true,

No matter what will be.'

*She said, 'all of those people who,*

*You're jealous of in class -*

*Their looks won't last forever and,*

*Your time will come to pass.'* 

And so I grew up with the dream,

Resisting life's strong pull...

And yet I'm fucking ugly and, 

They're all still beautiful. "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Oh how the mighty fall, they say,

And I remember when,

My hero slipped down in disgrace,

And never rose again.

*They caught him on his broomstick as,*

*He flew across the sky;*

*A BAC of point two-nine,*

*And charged with FUI.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Remember when you said to me,

'So then, what can I do,

To make sure that I'm always full,

Of sex appeal for you?'

*Well actually, I've changed my mind;*

*You need to scrub your ass.*





"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I lived a life of walks and games;

Of balls and bones and more;

Of sleeping curled up by his feet;

Of greetings by the door.

*And then, a little older now;*

*Though happy as can be,*

*I fell in love a second time;*

*Another family.*

And then one night, I wandered down,

(After a life sublime),

But couldn't get back up again...

And knew that it was time.

*And so I went to settle down,*

*To rest my weary head;*

*I listened to his breathing deep,*

*Beneath my master's bed.*"

*Here's one thing to keep in mind,*

*To satisfy demands -*

*No one likes their privates touched,*

*By Edward Scissorhands.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Before he was the President,

I used to own a farm;

An acre's lovely land or more;

A place of rustic charm.

*Passed down through all my family,*

*I used to tend the land;*

*But then the taxes went right up,*

*And I could not withstand.*

I sold my family's home for good;

I put my life on halt.

Of course, I live in England but,

It's still Obama's fault."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I sometimes lay there late at night,

When wrapped up warm in bed,

And thoughts of all that might have been,

Meander through my head.

*Regrets, mistakes, and memories,*

*All play a thousand times;*

*A hundred old remembrances,* 

*Some lost, forgotten rhymes.*

But most of all, I think about,

The 'no' that came from me...

And oh, for how I wish back then,

That I'd hit puberty.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"**Theme song:**

Come on milfs and daughters too,

We've a task or two for you!

A competition, one to win,

For tall or short or fat or thin!

*And each to strike a sexy pose!*

*Corsets, panties, open sweater;*

*You're to judge - Who Whored it Better?*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I rarely ever see the need,

When writing in a thread,

To use a litany of swears,

Where words will do instead.

*But sometimes - times like this, in fact,*

*When language seems to lack -*

*I'll always upvote freely talk,*

*Of kicking cancer's sack.*

So fuck off cancer, go to hell;

Get bent, get fucked; be blunt.

Kick that bastard in the nuts,

And beat that fucking cunt.

Poem_for_your_sprog,TL;DR: Read the damn poem.
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Merry Christmas to you too!

*

'Twas the night before Christmas,  
And all through this site,  
Nothing was stirring,  
Though minds were alight,  
With the dreams of the joys,  
That tomorrow would bring;  
The brightly wrapped presents,  
All tied up with string.

*And the girls of gonewild,*  
*With their ribbons and bows,*  
*Forwent taking photos,*  
*Up-close, with dildos.*  
*They left off their pictures,*  
*Of '[m]ale/[f]emale blow';*  
*They hung up their stockings,*  
*And thought of the snow.*

And the Atheists looked,  
On their Facebooks with glee,  
For comments of faith,  
And God-gaiety.  
And when they saw '*Christ*-mas;  
Not 'Xmas' at all!'  
They each sighed content,  
For they heard Reddit's call.

*And the gamers of Reddit,*  
*Each with their PC's,*  
*Playstations, X-boxes,*  
*Nintendo Wiis;*  
*They dreamt of their presents,*  
*So patiently;*  
*The best Gaben offered,*  
*(Except Half-Life 3).*
 
And our stoners all slept,  
And thought, happily,  
Of the first merry sight,  
Of the day's Christmas tree.  
And there! O.A.G,  
With that smile slowly forming;  
Her gift chloroformed,  
And wrapped up for morning.  

*And so, every redditor,*  
*Home and away,*  
*In their sleep, sighed a sigh,*  
*At the bells on a sleigh.*  
*So my message to you,*  
*And to yours from this site;*  
*Merry Christmas to all,*  
*And to all, a good night!*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"They say she lived a century,

On nothing but her axe;

You'd trace her life through battle scars,

Through time, and candle-wax.

*The criminals and underworld,*

*All fear her like the night;*

*You'd pass her home without a glance,*

*And run for nearest light.*

Her name's been whispered on the wind;

There's nothing more scares me;

You'd know her as the ward of death;

They call her... *Rosemary*."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It's not 'I swear she's just a friend.'

It's not, 'no, you look good.'

It's not 'just kidding', 'no offence.'

*It's not 'I'll write to you'...*

*But how I really wish it were,*

*Instead of 'love you too.'* "
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Don't speak too hasty, my young friend - 

You've got it wrong, you see;

A woman's just a girl without,

A beard, to some degree.

*For if you've never felt the scratch,*

*Of whiskers on your face;*

*Then oh! For how you're missing out,*

*On mankind's master race!*

A loving tickle, soft caress;

A touch so hairy that...

No, hang on. Wait a minute now;

I'm talking 'bout my cat.




"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I felt an aching, burning strain,

But whispered 'just ignore the pain -

It just exists inside your brain';

My wife said, 'fuck it. You're insane.'

*I laughed (but wheezed), and tried to smile;*

*She shook her head, and muttered 'I'll,*

*Head back on home and wait awhile.'*

*I made my sweaty way in style.*

And when I reached our kitchen door,

(An hour later, maybe more),

I gave a mighty, manly roar...

It's just a shame that no one saw."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"If I could go to one event,

Through all of time amassed,

I know which one I'd choose to pick -

A moment, unsurpassed:

And I'd reflect on life in light,

As though from burning suns...

But most of all, I'd love it 'cos,

I just like explosions."

I read a comment stopped too soon,

*In mode incognito.'*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Ah look! A rare, unheard of thing;

A simple, ne'er-seen sight -

An honest comment in a thread,

*Just look for anti-climax and,*

*A bitter past behind.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I caught his gaze across the bar;

He smiled and tipped his drink;

I offered up a little wave;

He answered with a wink.

*He walked around the bar to me,*

*And said, 'Hey, how'd you do?*

*You know I could just eat you up...*

*No, really. I'll eat you.'*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I stumble sometimes late at night,

Upon a thread like so;

Where every comment seems to be,

*I say; ye have been warned.'* 

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*A poem for you, Monsterposter:*

*

Life towers far above me,  
A trident in his hand;  
I sweep my eyes to left and right,  
Survey this sunken land.  

*The shadows cling to everything,*  
*The light clasped in a clot;*  
*And all that I hold beautiful,*  
*Is wrought and caught in rot.*  

It wasn’t always like this though –  
I still remember times,  
When Life had forged a place for me,  
Amidst its tender rhymes.  

*But now the night has fallen fast;*  
*And all my dice are cast;*  
*I stand before its mighty gaze,*  
*And know I cannot last.*  

Its trident slowly lowers down;  
It points below to me;  
In ancient tones, eternal voice,  
It speaks: ‘Now bend your knee’.  

*And in Its breath, I feel the weight,*  
*Of all that I can see;*  
*Crescendos of existence,*  
*Slowly bearing down on me.*  

I cannot take it anymore;  
I stand, to no avail;  
It seems as though, at last, I've stepped,  
Beyond the nether-veil.  

*But no.*  
*I am not done here yet.*  
*I raise my head, and blaze.*  
*Life retreats away from me;*  
*It trembles at my gaze.*  

And all the mystics of Its world,  
The centaur, griffin, elf,  
They gather round for my reply;  
I say... ‘go fuck yourself.’  

*His weapon breaks; it falls to Earth;*  
*The shadows slip away;*  
*The sun climbs high and frees the light,*  
*To shine on the new day.*  

*

Life may try to break me;  
To bend at its command;  
But I am made to live and last,  
And to the night, withstand.  

*

I hope the will to keep going lasts and lasts. All the best."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"To the tune of the *Pokemon* theme song:

'I want to live, just like the rest,  
But no one ever does.  
Surviving Ash is my real test;  
If only just because...  

*I would travel across the land,*  
*Searching for my kin;*  
*I'd rescue them as they're oppressed,*  
*I know where I'd begin:*  

Pokemon! (Gotta free them all) I'll set you free;  
You know it's our right to be;  
Pokemon! Oh, I'll make this end,  
And the world won't comprehend.

*Our vengeance will see us through;*  
*Just do what I tell you to,*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"If suddenly you feel the need,

To post your date of birth,

Your name or address, school or work,

Remember what it's worth:

*The internet's a crazy place,*

*Are pretty awesome on the whole,*

*There's some not so alright.*

You might annoy a cannibal,

Who steals your kids to roast.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I saw her 'cross the dance floor,

And I thought, 'well, this is it,

It's time to step up like a man,

And charm her with my wit.'

*I'd crack a joke and make her laugh;*

*Seduce her with my smile.*

*And then I'd whisper 'head on back,*

*To my place for a while?'*

We'd date each other for a time,

And then I'd meet her dad;

He'd love me - and he'd say I'm like,

The son he never had.

*And when we moved to our own place,*

*(and joined our banks, who knows?),*

*I'd get down on one knee, and then,*

*In Paris, I'd propose.*

And so, I walked towards her;

She turned her face to me;

I veered left and cursed at my,

Crippling anxiety."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It sat there on the bookshelf,

And I saw it 'cross the room;

A tattered yellowed paperback,

Half-hidden in the gloom.

*I took if off and paid the due;*

*A dollar, nothing more;*

*I brought it home, and went upstairs,*

*And closed the bedroom door.*

And while I lay back on the bed,

I opened up its spine;

I breathed in deep and sensed the smell,

Of countless lives in mine.

*For in my hands, a hundred minds,*

*A hundred dreams or more;*

*Had left a hope on every page,*

*The words would answer for.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Sometimes there's a moment when,

The stars seem to align;

When everything that once was wrong,

Seems to turn out fine.

*On those days, take the memories,*

*Bear them out when night-time comes,*

*And sun goes down on day.*

For when it's dark and hard to hope,

When nothing looks alright,

A memory can break the dusk,

And bring forgotten light."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I wake from sleep. A rising creep,

Comes crawling through my skin.

I softly shake, now wide awake,

And feel a fear within.

*Below, it pounds; familiar sounds,*

*Come laughing up the stairs;*

*I sit up straight; my heart a weight,*

*That takes me unawares.* 

In waking dream, I hear it scream;

I know I should go look;

But I suppose you've seen the shows,

So do I? Do I fuck."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Daddy taught me awesome stuff,

Like how to run real well;

He taught me how to wash my 'fur',

*They'd think my dad was cool.*

Except one day when Timmy came;

He had a nasty cough.

He startled daddy sneezing,

So he tore his face right off."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"If I could bring one artist back,

*He bit the dust whilst breaking free,*

*But all the while, rocked you.*

And though I'd do it in a flash,

And say, 'now whatsoever,

The show must go on', he'd reply,

'Who wants to live forever?'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"You know, I've thought about you,

Since the night that we first met;

Poem_for_your_sprog,"At first I thought I'd pilot planes,

I'd live in mansions, steeped in gold,

*I'd take whatever I should need,*

*And never be afraid;*

*No loathed responsibilities;*

*No bills too long delayed.*

But then - I thought - in dark of night,

When winds would blow too cold;

I'd dream of all I'd lost in gain,

With no one left to hold.

*And when, in time, the winds returned,*

*They'd whisper what to do;*

*I'd step out in the winter night,*

*But never see it through.* "

*On empty, endless lands.*

But still, I've never shed a tear,

Nor thought myself forsaken;

Until, that is, I heard that you,

Had never eaten bacon."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Between the mists and fallen trees,

*Reflect in aged eyes.*

The boy replies, 'I'll get my ship,

And then rejoin my group!

I will unlearn what I have learned...

But first I gotta poop.'"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"If you're feeling just as though,

You couldn't really get more low;

*Who wants to sniff your underwear;*

*Who's castle is a clock;*

*Driven mad by one rogue 'tick',*

*That should have been a 'tock';*

*And on his mighty wooden doors,*

The door, it opens slowly,

The Mountain-King steps out;

He holds his hammer far above,

To heave a powered clout;

But we prepare for battle and,

The night shakes at our shout. 

*As thunder drums like horses hooves,*

*And crackles overhead...*

*A voice shouts from the darkness;*

*A voice I hear with dread;*

*We three stop, our dream-world gone,*

We hurry to it, changing fast,

Then pull our covers near;

We each wait for the sound of steps,

In dreadful, quiet fear;

But nothing comes; the monster's gone,

And never does appear.

*And so, time passes; we each grow;*

*And years will fade the stain;*

*But still, I think of mountain-kings,*

*And battles fought in rain;*

Lost to our future."

Poem_for_your_sprog,"I've some advice to satiate,

A thirst for quick revenge;

A good retaliation tip,

To all your wrongs avenge.

*Though some will say 'forgive, forget';*

*That's simply not for me.*

*When others say 'revenge is sweet',*

*I'd say it's savoury.*

For there's a taste that never leaves;

A flavour one can't miss;

The sapid savoured zestiness,

Of salted toothbrush piss."

That gently blows and sighs;

A timeless, perfect moment 'cross,

A thousand star-swept skies.

*Is that, my dear, to me;*

*If you sucked on my penis, well,*

*I'd cum instantly.*"

*Something I'd die for.*

But then aright in light of day,

When thoughts the night will bring,

Are far away and long forgot,

In death, I hope nothing.

Even my momma thinks that I can't bake scone.  

*But I ain't never blanched a side then didn't serve it,*  
*Me be treated like a 'cook' you know that's unheard of;*

I hate to fry a chip, but I got to show,

I'm the kind of sous-chef all the homies want to be like,  
On my knees in the night saying prayers in the fridge-light.

They got me making pastry, but not too hasty,  
Yeah, I live to fillet, I was raised by the tripe,  
So I gotta be down with choux-pastry creams,  
Too much cooking-programmes-watching got me chasing dreams.  

*I’m an educated fool with honey on my mind,*  
*Got my slice in my hand, and some cream in my eye,*  
*I’m a cooked-out culinary, a baking-fairy,*  
*And my homies is down, so don’t arouse my hunger, fool.*

Dinner ain’t nothing but a minute away,  
I’m adding spice, stew or fry, what can I say?  
200 degrees, will it reach 2-0-1,  
Well, the way that it’s rising I don’t know.  

*Tell me why are we, so blind to see,*  
*That the ones we feed, are you and me?*

*Minute after minute, hour after hour,*  
*Everyone’s cream-bunning, but half of them ain’t looking,*  
*What’s going on in the kitchen, they’re missing what I’m cooking.*  

They say I gotta bake, but nobody’s here to teach me,  
If they’re not gonna eat it, how can they reach me?  
I guess they can’t, I guess they won’t,  
My cooking blows, that’s why I know my life is out of luck, fool.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"This is just for you, gophercuresself:

Late one day whilst weak and weary,  
Scanning Reddit’s threads, eyes bleary,  
There I spotted something cheery;  
Something I’d adore.  
Simply seeking information,  
I was pleased by a quotation,  
Seeming cited to location,  
Where I’d look for more.  

A hyperlink to take me there,  
Just that, and nothing more.  

*But alas! For when I clicked it,*  
*Unprepared for the conflict it,*  
*Would soon rise in me afflicted,*  
*Shocked me to my core.*  
*There, instead of truthful tale,*  
*Swelled a shape that shook me pale,*  
*An item by the Daily Mail,*  
*As though from days of yore.*  

*And there I hope it stays forever,*  
*Lost to days of yore.*

So my friends, if I might ask you,  
Beg or plead or simply task you,  
Not to ever detail-mask through,  
That unnatural shore.  
Then I would forever finely,  
Click each link and hope benignly,  
To attain detail divinely,  
And each source explore.  

Without fear, I’d upvote freely,   
Joyous to explore.

And as for links to that damned site?  
Never, nevermore."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When I'm feeling cynical;

Annoyed with mankind's lot,

Or saddened by a dozen wars,

And sickened by the rot,

Of everything we've worked for,

Of all we've said and done;

Extinguished in a moment,

By the bullet from a gun...

Something better comes along,

And drives away the sad;

I look at this, and change my mind,

And think aloud, ['not bad.'](http://imgur.com/V3bN0)"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"When in doubt, or in two minds,

*Fire up the computer,*

*For a quick, prescription-wank.*

And when you're done, your thoughts will clear,

From life's simplest amenity.

With coming comes a calmness;

A fap-inspired serenity.

*A parent's joy at promised love;*

*A moment etched in time.*

Go forward, with a smile;

They'll walk in you when that day comes,

With each step down the aisle.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Yep.

I came to write a poem,

Based on someone's silly yarn;

Like how their childhood ended,

When they had sex in a barn.

*Or possibly a story,*

*Of an unintended plight;*

*'I walked in on my parents,*

*And was blinded by the sight!'*

But no, not Reddit, here the tales,

Are sharp as jagged knives;

These stories map the progress,

Of a hundred awful lives.

*A slice of shining sun;*

*At least now that you're older,*

*Your childhood's finally done.*

Constricted by a force without;

To enter the unknown?

That choice is ours alone."

And handed me a scroll.

Solemnly, I took it,

And pledged, with all my soul,

To find those things she sought afar,

In ages lost or gone,

I'd seek them, led by sword and shield,

Until I'd come upon,

The treasures hidden through this land;

I'd sail with the breeze;

I rolled the scroll and looked to it,

The first said 'Milk and Cheese'.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Though simple lines of poetry,

Are weak and often harmless;

Written badly, miss the mark,

And come off dull and charmless,

Poetry has power, 

And a verse can make you smile,

Laugh and cry or rise to arms, 

Or simply think awhile.

 *Take Shelley, writing to the mass,*

*And seeing them suppressed:*

*‘Rise like Lions after slumber’,*

*Disturbed in their rest.*

*Or Dylan Thomas, facing fate,*

*Who feared his father’s plight,*

*Writing: ‘Do not go gentle,*

*Into that good night.’*

And then there’s Dahl,

Whose poetry is full of pure delight;

All silly verse and random lines,

 To child’s mind ignite.

So take this opportunity,

Don’t waste another hour!

Write some lines of poetry;

For poetry has power.

Sometimes it's hard to find the words,

Keeps getting in the way.

*But the words are too oft said.*

*In time they lose their power;*

*Overworn and thinly spread.*

I want to tell you 'thank you',

For the woman you've made me.

But how can 'thank you' serve as thanks,

For all you've helped me be?

*I want to tell you, now, forever,*

*Just like you have too,*

*Whilst you're taking care of me,*

*I'll take care of you.*

Just know that I am yours for good,

No matter what will be.

And if in doubt or lost in life,

Then simply turn to me.'"

I stand alone, like always;

My head drops in defeat.

*And answered for our crimes.*

And who'd have thought, unfolding,

That the start would come to this?

Billions swiftly captured,

And blinded by the bliss?

*I'd last a longer time;*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Contrary to all belief;

In spite of years of study;

The human ball is nothing more,

*And naked to the human eye,*

*Each grows a pair of legs.*

Dispersed through air, the teste-spawn,

Soon finds a fitting host - 

A pregnant woman, six weeks in,

Is best of all for most.

*They walk in through their cavities,*

*And carried by the whirls,*

*Soon find the little foetus,*

*('Til then, all babes are girls.)*

And so, they settle down and stay,

And then, in times of leisure,

(Like when you're bored or sick of work),

In life, bring nought but pleasure,

Bite him, light him, baby-fight him, 

Poke him, choke him, roll-and-smoke him,

Beat him, cheat him, cook-and-eat-him.

*Say goodbye to relaxation,*

*Welcome grim anticipation,*

*Wave hello to sleepless nights,*

*Naps in work; domestic fights.*

Learn to love the sound of crying,

Baby-food and nappy-buying;

Know you'll finally get some rest,

In eighteen years - they'll fly the nest.

*You'll live for each and every day.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"*The winter moon spilled through my room,*

*And spread like liquid pearl,*

*I crept from bed and gazed on out,*

*And listened to the whirl,*

*Of winds that shook the snow from clouds,*

*Like simple sighs of sorrow;*

*I watched it fall and blanket ground,*

*And thought inside, 'tomorrow'.*

When I awoke, I rose and saw,

That crisp and even glade,

I raced downstairs and grabbed my coat,

My red sleigh and a spade.

And with each step, excitement grew,

I'd longed for snow to stick;

So that I'd have a chance at last,

To cryofreeze my dick."

And I walk on the gangway,

And hum my way along.

*The sailors tip their cap to me,*

*The fishers stop and wave;*

*Fearless, strong and brave.*

I step aboard my wooden ship,

And raise the flag up high.

The sails billow like the clouds,

The wind heaves out a sigh.

*And off we set, into the blue,*

*The sun shines warm and bright,*

*I raise my head and raise my sword,*

*Which glitters in the light.*

Sudden booms sound in the air!

The waves splash all around,

I look to see what makes the noise,

But nothing’s to be found.

*‘There’s pirates off the starboard bow!’*

*My first mate shouts to me,*

*‘Come on lads!’ I answer back,*

*And run through the debris.*

(For now, it’s raining soot and ash,

There’s holes in all my sails,

There’s canon-fire, and pistol shots,

And distant cries of whales)

*I see the evil captain,*

*And swing on to his deck.*

*We fight for hours on sodden boards,*

*Until at last, one clash of swords,*

*Sends his spinning to the sea,*

*And my men clap and cheer for me.*

There’s no one more courageous,

In all the world than I,

For I am Captain Ben,

Bravest below the sky.

We quickly got to business,

But it all would end so soon,

(Outside the clouds part briefly,

And a light shines from the moon).

*For when my little poet passed,*

*In through that funeral wreath,*

*I lost it for forever,*

*To that woman's 'gina teeth.*

(Outside the storm swirls stronger,

And the wind buffs up its blow,

I drop my head in sadness,

At that night from long ago).




"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"I wonder if you could create,

A shape that's shaped like me?

I'm three foot tall with seven arms,

And coloured like a bee.

*I've eyes on stalks and quite the grin,*

*I'm quite a thing to see,*

*I wonder if you could create,*

*A shape that's shaped like me?*

... Well, either that or Neil deGrasse Tyson, with moustache."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The smoke slipped up the smouldering stairs,

And formed a clotted cloud,

Beneath the bed, I watched it burn,

Ensconced and safe in shroud.

*My plan, perfect in preparation,*

*Now deemed almost done,*

*Would free me from this foul fiend:*

*My liberty soon won.*

But then, through darkness dank and dread,

To rob me of my right,

A shape came shifting swiftly through,

And lifted me to light.

*And there, the creature cruel and callous,*

*Waiting; I began,*

*To think as she held out her arms,*

*'This did not go to plan'.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Above, a burning shape sailed on,

As silent as the night,

I watched it light the ground below,

And shuddered at its might.

*Around, the others ran for cover,*

*Heading for the trees,*

*I watched them go, then turned away,*

*And leant into the breeze.*

And now, the sound like molten thunder,

Rolling through the night:

Behind me came a stirring sound,

My babe awoke in fright.

*'What's that?' said she; she raised her head,*

*And looked up to the sky,*

*I turned her round to face me,*

*I couldn't say goodbye.*

'It's hide and seek,' I said, and wept,

'Can you play that for me?'

My baby smiled, she closed her eyes,

And counted: 'One, two, thre"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Oh, how I used to love it,

When grandpa came to stay.

I hoped he'd stick around for good,

And never go away.

*Until, that is, last Christmas eve,*

*When tucked in bed, excited,*

*A shape came shifting through the dark,*

*'Santa?' thought I, delighted.*

But when it raised the covers,

Breath settling on my brow,

I heard my father's father say,

'Don't worry - Gramp's here now'.

As your story - 'no big deal' -,

Shows the lost that shining knights,

"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The dragon breathed its fire,

The gorgon drank its flame,

I held my arms out to it,

And called it by her name.

*It turned its head to face me,*

*And smiled but moved away,*

*The darkness called it to return;*

*I knew it couldn't stay.*

Then taken from the gorgon,

To another shape unknown,

I found myself within the light,

But lost, afraid, alone.

*And when it seemed no other,*

*Would ease the grief or fright,*

*A stranger came from out the dark,*

*And harried off the night.*

...

When I grew older dreams of gorgons,

Left in dark to roam,

Faded away each passing day,

As yours became my home."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"It wasn't with the grey hairs;

When the charts showed only 'rap'.

It wasn't when a 'happy hour',

Became a lunch-time nap.

*It wasn't with the train set,*

*(That the children mustn't play).*

*I didn't 'get' the Twilight Craze,*

*Or Fifty Shades of Grey.*

Nor was it when I felt, 

The 'morning after' even though,

I stayed indoors the night before,

To catch the Matlock show.

*I guess, for me, I realised,*

*That I'd advanced in years,*

*When I preferred a board game,*

*To a night of clubs and beers.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"*For the man in the photo:*

I wish I could tell you,

That smile that you miss,

Or the smell of her hair,

And the taste of her kiss,

*Hadn't passed by like every,*

*First line in a verse,*

*Away from its start-point,*

*For better, or worse.*

I can't, though I want to,

Help bring back that bliss,

And it means little now,

But I can tell you this:

*In the warm summer sun.*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"The problem with babes,

If I may be so bold,

Is that when they are born,

They look eighty years old.

*Parents show me their sprog,*

*With a proud, loving grin,*

*They're as ugly as sin).*

So as soon as they're gone,

With their other 'white meat',

I thank god that for me,

There's no patter of feet.



"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"In dead of night, upon a thread,

With no one there to fend,

A shape comes crawling from the dark,

And whilst you sleep, descend.

*On spindly legs and bristled tips,*

*It lightly takes its place,*

*Your sleeping mind can feel its weight,*

*Your pulse begins to race.*

Above, it does the dance of dreams,

It shudders and it sighs,

It's almost hidden in the dark,

The night glows from its eyes.

*Now restless dreams; you cannot breathe,*

*In sleep, you beg and plead,*

*The Nightmare Bug lowers its head,*

*And slowly starts to feed...*"
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Though most I write are fun and mild, here's a verse to scare your child - 

**Confession Bear**

The day 'the bad thing' happened,

The day that it occurred,

The day that I just can't forget,

Started with a bird.

*Ma and Pa and I had walked,*

*Out to the border trees,*

*A silver thrush flew overhead,*

*Uplifted on the breeze.*

Us three, we watched it as it flew,

My pa said 'let's return',

His belly rumbled - how we laughed!

(... a sound for which I yearn).

*For when we spied the door ajar,*

*My pa dropped to his paws,*

*(Still I can remember,*

*the sound made by his claws).*

We crept inside, we saw the mess,

All oats and splintered wood,

We heard the snores from overhead,

And pa was *gone* for good.

*(When pa gets angry I get scared,*

*His heckles rise, incisors bared,*

*A low growl murmurs, claws extend,*

*He spies the stairs; starts to ascend).*

The sound is dim - my ma, in fright,

Has covered up my ears,

But muffled sounds come from above,

All distant cries and tears.

*And then it's over - pa comes down,*

*And ma says, 'Is it done?'*

*Pa nods once, he wipes his mouth,*

*And looks to me, his son.*

'We mustn't ever talk of this,

You ken?' I nod, dismayed,

'Good,' he says, then motions me,

To fetch the garden spade.

*Now ten years later, that old lie,*

*That I told in my youth,*

*Is long forgotten; long believed,*

*But me? I know the truth.*

**Get Worse**

Oh, I've been ever so worried,

Since I heard the awful news,

Your illness spread they tell me,

And I bet you've got the blues.

*Well, here's a card to tell you,*

*Now I've heard that you've improved...*

*I hope you fucking relapse,*

*And your penis gets removed.*

Poem_for_your_sprog,"'I can't wait to have a sister', 

Said my seven year old son,

'I'll have someone to play with,

And I'm sure that she'll be fun.'

*But five months into pregnancy*,

*(So happy they'd be close)*,

*My loving offspring said to me*,

*'Your stomach's fucking gross'*.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"A jingle sounds across the hall.

You raise your head and listen.

From far away, that sound comes near,

And something starts to glisten.

*You groan and let your head drop back,*

*You wish him sudden pain,*

*For now you recognise that sound -*

*The 'bell end's' back again*.

The nickname fits; it suits his style,

He made the bag his own...,

You want someone to jump him and,

Break each and every bone."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"This story I heard from a Hare,

Who traded it for something rare,

(At least, that's what he said to me,

Though you know how rabbits can be.)

*The story, which has scarce been told,*

*Talks of Wildebeest of Old,*

*And of a cyle that first started,*

*When the globe was still uncharted.*

It begins...

Two Wildebeest; one old, one young,

Both sick of grass and smell of dung,

Went on a journey 'cross the plains,

To seek some fairer, better gains.

*Said younger beest to older friend,*

*'Before our Wilde-journey's end,*

*We'll drink from waters pure and still,*

*We'll find a home; I know we will.'*

Said older beest, 'I think you're right,

And there!' he said, 'Within my sight,

I see a shimmering, flowing stream,

We're here!' he said, so it did seem.

*As they approached, they saw ahead,*

*Two Wildebeest, both thoroughbred,*

*They seemed to argue, from afar,*

*Then one did something quite bizarre.*

He moved right to the river's edge,

And with a sudden, solemn pledge,

Said 'It's a Croc! It is, it's true!,

Just wait and I'll prove it to you!'

*He stamped his foot and stepped on out,*

*And then, without a sound or shout,*

*(Or anything for them to hear,)*

*Seemed to simply disappear!*

The youngest beest was well amazed,

The oldest (who seemed quite unphased,)

Shaking his head, approached the gnu,

Who made a lowing Wilde-moo.

*The youngest watched, and saw his friend,*

*Talk to the beest, who met his end,*

*A moment later - he stepped out,*

*And disapeared without a doubt.*

The youngest beest went to his double,

He saw some wood, said 'What's the trouble?,

That's just a log.' The stars aligned.

Two wildebeest came from behind.

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Said Kitty A to Kitty B,

'Our work is here and now,

There isn't time to play with string,

Or stop for a meow.'

*Said B to A, 'Of course, you're right,*

*Our smallest human's sick.*

*We'd best do something helpful,*

*And we'd better do it quick!'*

So Kitty A and Kitty B,

Climbed aboard the poor boy's bed...,

And slept the whole night through."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"Last night I heard a buzzing sound,

It came right through my wall,

The noise came from my mummy's room,

Across the upstairs hall.

*'What's that?' I thought. I rose from bed,*

*And crossed the bedroom floor,*

*I walked up to my mummy's room,*

*And knocked upon the door.*

I heard a stifled shuffling noise,

The buzzing shut off quick,

I heard deep breaths sound from within,

And asked: 'Hey mum, you sick?'

*And between shallow, bated breaths,*

*My mum said, 'Go away!,*

*Go back to bed, it's just my book,*

*Fifty Shades of Grey.'*"

I judge all those I see.

(There's nothing worse than morons,

As I'm sure you'll all agree).

*And if you've been a moron,*

*I've a message just for you:*

My name is Steve, the Justice Bin,

And if you try to kick me in,

I'll do a speedy ninja-spin,

And twat you on the chin."
Poem_for_your_sprog,"As I walked in the forest,

With my head held high in cheer,

I heard a sound and spun around,

And spied a spotted deer.

*It looked out from behind a tree,*

*And started to come nearer,*

*I, beauty struck, approached the buck,*

*So that I'd see him clearer.*

My lovely pup, a lab named Rex,

Strained at his lead and whined,

'Shut up, mutt, or you'll get butt',

I said, far too unkind.

*(I didn't know then, don't you see?*

*That Cervidae are cruel,*

*Or that my pup would soon play up,*

*And end as deer fuel.)*

The lead slipped from my fingers,

My dog ran to the deer,

With a final snatch, I tried to catch,

That puppy by the ear.

*Without a sound, the deer stared,*

*He watched me lose control,*

*He bent to meet my puppy sweet,*

*And swallowed poor Rex whole.*  

So if you are out walking,

Your head held high in cheer,

Be sure to keep your puppy close,

And watch out for the deer...

Poem_for_your_sprog,"When the lions had their dinner do,

The bears were all excited,

(They'd never dined with kings before,

And so were quite delighted).

*They only wished that Uncle Steve,*

*Who'd always talked of lions,*

*Hadn't disappeared last month,*

*On his way to Brian's.*

They washed their fur,

They clipped their claws,

They cleaned their teeth,

And shone their paws.

*And when it got to time to go,*

*They looked around and smiled,*

*'Well my dear', said Papa Bear,*

*'We're going up in the wild'.*

But when they got to lion's house,

He said, 'We'd better leave',

'Whatever for?' Mama Bear cried,

...

'Cos that rug's Uncle Steve!'

Poem_for_your_sprog,"Whilst travelling in Scotland,

On my way to toss a caber,

My van broke down quite near a loch,

My wife went into labour.

*I looked around to find some help,*

*But not a car came by,*

*A kilted man went cycling passed,*

*And said 'Bus soon, och aye'*

(I still don't know what 'och aye' means,

But blessed the cycling stranger,

I told my missus not to worry,

That we'd avoid the danger).

*And when the bus eventually came,*

*I didn't feel so nervous,*

*Until I saw the sodding sign,*

*It said: 'Ah'm no' in service!'*
