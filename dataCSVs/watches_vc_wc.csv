**Description:**|Grabbed this from an auction back in december but it had a chipped crystal, so I had Chan replace the crystal and look it over, but **it was not serviced**. It runs well, and its in good shape for a 38 year old watch. It has the hacking seconds and quickset date movement. Only downside is that it does not have all bracelet links but enough to fit a 7-7.5"" wrist and it is an old jubilee, so its very stretched - the positive is that its also super comfortable. This is a fairly unique version as i have had a very hard time finding any sold comps in the same configuration. I tried to be fair and grab every comp possible putting more weight on those that were more closely matched. The average of all sold comps (the majority are steel only versions) comes to $2560. Taking the outlier high and low, its still $2530. The only TT sold comp is $2400 and its a franken with swapped bezel and jubilee. If you think I am off on my pricing please let me know - I dont claim to know everything and I could be missing some detail. "
vc_wc,"I had asked about interest in [this IWC Antoine De Saint Exup√©ry chrono](https://i.imgur.com/X3EHee7.jpg) just in case it didnt work for me. Based on the interest I got, I pulled the trigger on the trade i had lined up and im happy I did. 

This thing is gorgeous! Hard to take pics to show the brown sundial, but its as mesmerizing as a GS dial. I am still concerned about the price so I dont know if it will stay but im giving it a fair chance. "
vc_wc,"i assume you are in international/canada?

Yeah, they changed their fees a while back, may be like 6 months or even possibly longer"

vc_wc,Ooof. Cant do much about the conversion fee. But the transfer fee could be avoided
vc_wc,Sure. Send me $2002.99 and I'll pay for all your spots up to $1500. This way you don't have to pay any fees to PayPal
vc_wc,Lol we'll get right on that
vc_wc,Right?! I'm looking to figure out pricing. Going to give first dibs to anyone looking for a birth year watch though
vc_wc,"That's shady... Thanks for the info.

Are you pretty sure this is fake? Some said 35mm vs 40mm have different details. But idk much about this model."
vc_wc,Did he delete his posts? I didn't see any
vc_wc,"I'm curious, can you post a real one to compare? What should the size be? Are crowns marked? Never heard of a 703. "
vc_wc,"Wait, are you saying this is a fake? I ask because you are, perhaps, the most knowledgeable poster here, so it would actually carry a lot of weight if you do say it's fake."
vc_wc,hmmmm love chorizo
vc_wc,but not too big for your salami
vc_wc,just did. its 1989. sorry.
vc_wc,lol nah

**Description:**|Mint condition SBDX001 with original box, bracelet, unused Seiko rubber strap, and mint Crafter Blue in black. This thing is a stunner and all of the hype around MM300s is 110% true. Bezel, case, crown, crystal, dial, hands are all mint. Movement running strong, keeping great time with a great power reserve. Crafter Blue strap still smells like vanilla and is mint condition. Clasp shows some desk diving marks but could easily be ScotchBrited to be perfect. Bracelet also shows some desk diving marks but is in great condition otherwise.

vc_wc,i literally rather talk about conspiracies on how to manipulate the bot
vc_wc,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
vc_wc,"yeah i'll soak up all the salt. But i would be terrible at it, because i wouldnt flip stuff. maybe after wearing it for a while if i dont like it. I def wouldnt continue to just buy and try to win everything just to flip.  I love gambling but there are enough attractive raffles for stuff i would keep that i dont have to enter everything."
vc_wc,I think this would be the 3rd time it goes up and i prob could have just bought it after lowballing the shit out of the first owner... but yeah tag me hard
vc_wc,so you are saying you are one of those in the black? hang on let me grab my pitchfork
vc_wc,"i lost a breitling i ended up with 40% due to a step i hit. before the bot was called, /u/bobjacobson (who had 20% i think) asked me if I wanted to hedge by combining our chances. But I trusted math and statistics, and they failed me, so of course the bot called his number. LOL

It was a really nice breitling too :(
"
vc_wc,LOL
vc_wc,sorry about yesterday bb
vc_wc,"you are not wrong... but you kinda are. I think what you are saying is true for most people that have won here. There are some that have had very long winning streaks (after long losing streaks, or long losing streaks since), and some of them were in the black, most still in the red. 

But... there are a handful that are deep in the black. Some have been lucky, hitting 1-3%, others are playing strategy and going deep, and the way math works, they will win more often. But there is significant risk, and at one point it will normalize and catch up. You only have to lose 5 raffles at 20% to be back to break even on 1 big win. 

I am not into setting a rule for spot limits, but I think we should encourage rafflers and escrows to use them. Some people just want to sell stuff so no spot limits makes sense, others know that the item will sell so they can have spot limits and it will just take a few minutes longer to fill than usual.

I like having the freedom. I didnt do spot limits on this one, but I will do spot limits on the next main raffle. "

**Description:**|Up for raffle is a pristine Grand Seiko SBGV225. The watch is powered by the super accurate 9F quartz movement. It features a 40mm case, sapphire crystal, zaratsu polish, and is only 10mm thick. The dial is the star of the show. It has a unique blue-teal sunburst that is captivating. I've tried to capture it in the gif. Don‚Äôt miss your chance at winning this incredible watch with all the amazing details and GS goodness. MSRP is $2800. This is a full set with box and papers. Card is dated 10/2018, so there‚Äôs plenty of Grand Seiko warranty left. The watch is in excellent condition. Hard to spot any hairline scratches. There is a tiny ding on the bottom of the bezel (might be able to see it in the first pic). It‚Äôs really nothing and could be easily brushed out, but just mentioning it for full disclosure. Other than the watch is immaculate and, imo, could almost pass for new. For more information, visit the Grand Seiko website here: https://www.grand-seiko.com/global-en/collections/sbgv225g

Some other rules are that the lock is only 60 days for Eastern region, and 90 days for Western region. 

Also, in theory, you can re lock your incentives the second month (but you lose the first month incentives) and have that or the delivery month incentives. It only makes sense if they are that much better, it has happened though.

**Description:**|Omega Aqua Terra 2517.30 39.2mm mens watch. The watch is used but in great working condition. Warranty card dated to 2006. The watch shows normal wear, but there is no damage and no major scratches. In my opinion its in great shape for being 13 years old. Previous owner mentioned that it was serviced last year, but i have no proof. Currently sized for a 7.25 inch wrist. Comes with 3 extra links so it should fit an 8 inch wrist or so. Comes with a leather strap and a genuine Omega deployment clasp. 20mm lug width. Sapphire crystal is flawless. Keeps great time (Obviously, its quartz). Box, warranty cards, manual, original sales receipt, leather strap and deployment clasp included.

**Description:**|Up for raffle is the highly desired, yet hard to find Tudor Black Bay 58 on bracelet (79030n). In my opinion, the Fifty-Eight has perfect dimensions, a much slimmer profile than 41mm version. This is a full set with box and papers. Card is dated 08/2018, so still a lot of Tudor warranty left. Overall, it is in really good condition. Nothing egregious or noteworthy; just some normal wear on bracelet and clasp that could be polished/brushed out if you really wanted to.

vc_wc,"How much was the watch?

Did you not get a note from the carrier with an import form to fill?

I have always gotten a form that you have to declare the value and you break down the components and the value. And they tax you based on that. If you didn't get one, the sender might have done it, or the carrier was lazy and just did it. 

The only time I didn't get the form was when I didn't get taxed on it.

There might be an appeal, and if there is I'd fill out the import declaration form and assign the right values to the components. 

Pro tip, assign the least value to the case and the bracelet, they get taxed the highest. The movement and crystal get taxed the least. At least that's what I remember. Be realistic though, don't be an idiot."
vc_wc,"As for the 7750 keeping time, it really depends on the manufacturer and how they adjust it and if they modify it. I'm not sure if there are different quality tiers in those but I'll tell you I have had several watches with the 7750.

I have 2 Panerai that are the most accurate I ever had, blows my mind. They both have the wobble, although it's more pronounced on the bigger watch. I have also had lower end 7750 (junghans) and the time keeping was fine but the wobble was death. Felt like it was trying to run away from my wrist.

I wouldn't be afraid of the 7750, and on a positive note thank are super easy and cheap to service compared to an in house movement. Also parts are readily available.

The resale is going to be brutal on both. If anything, the IWC might hold up better as a freshly signed warranty card from an AD. There are less of them as well. The Omega will be more available and probably have more demand. 

I would choose the one you like best and the one you will wear the most and it's most likely to be kept long term. "
vc_wc,I really really have to get on that and insure my collection. I have been procrastinating. Not so much the cost but they ask you to get them appraised and that's time consuming
vc_wc,"That can't be right. 

I bright a Tudor to an AD a couple of months ago with a Canadian warranty card that was expiring within a week and they honored the warranty after asking a few questions. 

Tudor wanted to see the physical card so we had to mail it after the fact but it was not an issue. 

What's the story behind the drop? Were you trying to take a pantless wristy? "
vc_wc,"Hey that's super kind, I really appreciate it!"
vc_wc,hey /u/Uncle_Paul_Hargis I would post in all his WUS threads as well. Try PM'ing him there first?

vc_wc,"Personally I like this better than adding to the cost of the raffle. For those of us that play in every raffle and dont have the win rate that others have, that little bit extra everytime will add up to a lot over time.

Also, while I like all of the guys that win often here; I dont feel bad at all if they have to kick back a tiny bit to maintain the community safe and give back. I know that I would do this without question if i was winning 3-4 times a month. We are talking about less than $50 for winning a $5000 rolex. 

Sign me up! If any winner doesnt want to take a win because of the 1% let me know and i'll take the burden off your hands!"

vc_wc,"Out of curiosity, WTF are they thinking?

And domestic manufacturers wonder why they don't do better. Why lock out another way for their dealers to possibly move another unit?

If that's their policy, do they even have pull ahead programs? "
vc_wc,"hey thank you so much!

truly appreciated!"
vc_wc,"I mean, you are welcome. But I didnt run the Orion. Nice haul though!"
vc_wc,"What was the reason for making that change? You are right, I can still downvote but most people won't go through the trouble. 

I just can't figure out why suppress votes"
vc_wc,Price is one. Removing the inability to downvote is another. Should consider some rules to overcome what's been happening due to increased traffic.
vc_wc,"No offense, because I know moderating can be a thankless job, but just because a rule can't be enforced the solution is not to remove it. But to tweak the rules, or adjust your process to be able to enforce it.

Some of us have suggested a few different ideas. Put it in the title, have a bot make a copy of the original OP, etc

If it was enforced, I believe you, but there is a lot of that still going on.

As for becoming more like wus I didn't mean because of changes you made. I meant that the increase in traffic and posts is turning it into wus; and personally I think the only way to counter it is with rules and enforcement. Otherwise what's your differentiator? "
vc_wc,Nah. It means all remaining at the time of request. You can't preorder spots that don't exist. 
vc_wc,"You are wasting your time. 

&gt; Agreed. I‚Äôm a total noob here ‚Äî this was my first raffle and I got shut out too. (By how much I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm sure it was by a lot and I‚Äôm okay with that.) But it kind of pissed me off when I saw people requesting 10 and 20 spots ‚Äî and getting them. I get the whole free market/capitalism/freedom thing, but that just feels wrong.

He figured it all out without buying into a single raffle. You stand no chance"
vc_wc,Lol this guy can't escrow shit. He is inCanada. Nobody would pay a fee. You have no clue of what you are talking about. It's embarrassing.
vc_wc,"You figured, after your first raffle. Lol

In any case, where does your change, make a difference to an escrow? Definitely not in the chances to win, and not in the comp for their time and effort. So how greed has anything to do with it, I don't understand.

Where having spot limits makes a difference is that raffles may go unfilled. Like I said, I don't care but you keep saying I'm arguing against it vehemently (and hysterically) lol. I'm against forcing people when they have a choice.

You are so clueless, I have no control over the spot limit. That's up to the seller, not to the escrow. So it doesn't make a difference to me. But hold on to your tin foil hat.

To be fair you must be a genius, cause you have figured it all out after you missed your first raffle. Unlike the 3k plus people here and those here for about 3 years. What suckers!

Good luck man, I bet you win soon. Cause RNGesus sort of loves pulling shit like that and rewarding it"
vc_wc,"See, this is not a new conversation. We have done this before. We have seen it happen. 

But since you are trying to imply something, you should at least say it straight up instead of cowardly implying. But then everyone would know whatever you are thinking is really foolish.

The effect you seem to miss is that some raffles will go unfilled, enough of that and you lose sellers, enough of that and you don't have buyers.

Are there some raffles that are a guaranteed fill? Sure. Should those have spot limits? I don't really care tbh. But that's an option already, why impose the will of some on other people? How are the mods to force only some raffles to have spot limits? 

But hey you know let's blame others for not accommodating us instead of critically thinking through, or asking those that have been around if something has been considered. "
vc_wc,"Speaking of gumlo, seems he has a bunch of siblings"
vc_wc,"To be fair, I interpreted the same way, that people feel entitled to a spot so I get his response.

Would it be more fun if more people participated? I'm not so sure. I definitely don't have more fun when people ask for a spot and don't pay in time, or pay wrong, or ask for spots in confusing ways. 

On the other hand I get very happy when new people win, I think it's cool. 

So I'd like to see more people participate but maybe they should take the time to really get engaged in the community before they try to change how we do things?"
vc_wc,"But then cry babies will impose spot price limits because it's not fair that they can't afford a spot.

There seems to be a misconception that a raffle should award participation trophies. 

So yeah, it's about filling a raffle not about how many individuals get a spot. I could care about having more people participate and add spot limits, that's already an option but I run the risk it won't fill. If I have to cancel then I'd have to discount to run it again. "
vc_wc,"Lol thats fair enough. But those that got in the first 25 seconds did exactly that.

I know that I have official time up on one screen and I refresh as much as possible on the other. My request is in the clipboard and ready to go.

But when I miss it I'm grateful I saved a bunch of money. "
vc_wc,"Lololol

I was wise beyond my years..."
vc_wc,"
You know, I want to be welcoming to our new members, and I sympathize with the challenges in the sub. But it really grinds my gears when new folks think they have it figured out and want to change the sub when they have been here for a hot minute.

The whole spot limits issue has been discussed forever. I'm personally not against it, but it does encroach on personal freedom.

When a raffle has spot limits, and it doesn't fill in the first hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, are these guys going to pay the seller for their trouble? Are they going to commit to buying the rest of the spots?

What happens when those that go big can't, and decide they don't want to play anymore. Are these guys going to fill every raffle? Or they will get cancelled, and if we get a lot if cancellations maybe sellers will decide it's not worth the hassle, so no items will come.

Yeah you know sometimes it sucks to miss it but in reality, you saved a bunch of money. But people are being self absorbed and self centered, instead of looking at the sub and community as a whole. It's just selfish."
vc_wc,"Your comment about usernames is so idiotic that it invalidates the rest of your post.

Also, maybe you should consider asking the right question. A suggestion similar to syz, I had already floated for our Canadian friends to avoid fees. And if I trust you and you are willing to pay a premium to cover the risk I'm taking, I would do something. 

But if I'm going to do that, why g&amp;s? I'm providing a service and you'd have to trust me with your $. If we are already there then just use wires or other methods that would be safer.

Honestly, even though I would help out some folks I still wouldn't do it as g&amp;s and that has nothing to do with being xenophobic, it's about risk. Plenty of cases of people getting really fucked by people doing chargeabacks.

Finally, it's not that we are more concerned about US users, is that the majority of users are from the us and not enough international and it has nothing to do with f&amp;f. It's more due to the fees from PayPal which we can't control unless you also want us to cover them. The cost of shipping, which you probably also want us to cover, and the time of the raffle. Let's inconvenience 99% of the user base just in case we can get another 5-10 international users.

You should send a msg to modmail, maybe the mods have better suggestion"
vc_wc,"TIL that allowing people to mitigate risk is xenophobic.

First, besides fraud, do you have any factual information why PayPal limits f&amp;f in some countries?

Do you have a source for your claim on other countries having lower fraud rate? It's possible, but in what context? Maybe in their own country, I don't know.

You know why fraud is more common from international users? Because we can't prosecute you. A US fraudster carries more risk as we can find them, and file police reports, and possibly catch them. Especially in raffles as we have all the information we need. But if you are based in another country, not Canada, it's going to be very hard for someone to go after you. 

Finally, G&amp;S has also other implications besides fraud risk. For example, someone receiving g&amp;s is subject to IRS reporting. The limits are even lower.

You are complaining here but you should be going after PayPal to open up their service in your country. And from what it sounds, they will be tightening security and information requirement soon. So it's going to get even tougher. "
vc_wc,"The protections in place for buyers are there via rules the not put in place.

You can't raffle anything above $500 unless you are verified. Everything else is escrowed, which guarantees that seller can't get the money unless they deliver the goods. Outside of that why would they get the money back?
Sellers are going to be a hard time scamming you here for items over $500. You are still responsible for vetting the seller as in any other marketplace. But we are by far safer than other communities.  

You haven't been around long, have you? It sucks that it happened, but you are going to say that we need rules for usernames? Should we also schedule things in the middle of the night for our Asian friends? Maybe we should allow any currency? 

For a minute i thought you were serious, but reading your last paragraph tells me you are just an idiot troll. "
vc_wc,"Or... Hear me out. 

There is a reason PayPal doesn't allow f&amp;f in some countries. One of those reasons for some countries is fraud.

As someone that runs a bunch of raffles, I would first switch to USA only before I accept g&amp;s payments.

It sucks for the very few people with this issue, but the risk is too high. "

vc_wc,i would like to know where the observation comes from though. What problem are you trying to solve?
vc_wc,spicy
vc_wc,"I had not seen it before, just came across a month or so ago. The brown sunburst dial has me mesmerized. I also like IWC in general so this could be a good fit. Only downside for me is the 43mm. 

I have watches that are bigger, but im trying to stay in the 40mm range. It all depends how it will wear. "
vc_wc,what are you looking for. there are some things that move very fast
vc_wc,"but those are people that were not going to buy anyway. or some people do bring fair points, and i try to learn from those.

As a seller, its never bothered me too much. If you are trying to be fair, the item will move based on demand. If you are trying to squeeze all you can, then you may have a bad time. And if thats the case, then become a dealer.

Its like selling a car. you can trade it in for a soft value, or you can sell it yourself, deal with tirekickers, and get a little bit more than trade value, but you are not getting full retail. 

Hiding prices to try to get one over the community is not the right approach, and yeah thats how I see it. There is no valid reason to remove prices.  
"
vc_wc,"if someone is low-balling you based on 1 comp that was dumped, do you really want to deal with them? they will prob give you a shitty time about shipping and then condition, and who knows what. Just deal with fair people. 

A low sale is a data point. If its truly a dump, then it should go quickly, but if it sits for weeks then maybe there is no market for the item, and that low sale point might be the new market until conditions change. IDK, i look at all sold items to base my evaluation of a fair market value. So the more info the better. "
vc_wc,"I have seen questions about this and i was wondering the same, when and why the requirement/rule to keep the price posted was removed. 

IMO it would have been nice from the mods to at least let us know there were changes. Maybe I missed the announcement.

The rule to leave the price behind was last seen about 5 months ago. Not that it mattered as it was never enforced anyway. 

Personally I think that was another of the positives of watchex compared to other marketplaces, transparency of information. It feels like slowly we are devolving into another WUS since watchrecon picked it up

New:
&gt; 1. **After-sale etiquette**:  Please write **[SOLD]** in comment section.  Flair will be changed automatically.  You must write it exactly ""[SOLD]"".	

Old:	

&gt; 1. Please write **SOLD** in comment section, and select the 
&gt;	""Sold"" flair for you post, when appropriate.  *Please leave 
&gt;	the price information.*"
vc_wc,"I might be taking this (not this exact watch, but same ref) in trade. And I am worried about the 43mm size. If i end up not loving it, would there be interest in a raffle? FMV is going to be around $6k, maybe a little less.

If there is interest I'll feel better about the trade. just in case. and lets be real, it prob ends up here anyway."
vc_wc,"Let be real though, chances are they lock you up since you look more like a terrorist than anyone else here"
vc_wc,I had one. I regret selling it
vc_wc,tag me on the raffle escrow for the speedy :)
vc_wc,"I would like to donate all my spots to /u/rivven1 - he should be in the list but i missed it. thats my bad. 

And thank you everyone for donating spots, it was not my idea, i dont even like this guy. You all can thank /u/ryancg12 for thinking about it. But you know, he is an idea man, follow through is not his thing. 

Also, to all those that contributed. We ended up collecting a little more than we needed. I have been trying to make as much interest from it as possible. So far im up about $0.13 but we'll see how the market behaves. 

One idea was to do a raffle with multiple winners to kick back the leftover to those that contributed - say 10 winners @ $45? Or we considered buying a watch (its under $500) and raffling that. Do you all have a preference, let me know here. We'll do whatever you all prefer, except /u/malicious_farts - fuck that guy"
vc_wc,"congrats /u/bobjacobson!!!

Thats a really nice win. going big paid off"

vc_wc,you would have to downvote so much so often to accomplish that. Thats not how the reddit algorithm works anyway. 
vc_wc,"No worries. The price in the title has been an idea I have also floated several times, with the only purpose of maintaining information. Your argument against it is not that strong either, i mean you can still have your different prices on the main post for people to read. It is not uncommon to see $xxxx +3% for G&amp;S -5% via wire + a blowie

LOL we are going to agree to disagree on the other sub. I have only had good experiences, and I think it comes down to transparency. My understanding is that they tend to price to the avg, and people try to cherry pick the high comps. In a way, they do have a point, much of the stuff is a guaranteed sale with no hassle really. no brainer to take a market average to move something quickly. But yeah if you want top of the market or have patience to wait it out then yeah, you can do better elsewhere. 
"
vc_wc,"well thats the problem. You are thinking of it as fashion :)

I think downvotes are as valid expression as anything. I might not like the item, or the seller, or the pictures, or the price. Why does it matter why i downvote? Nobody asks why people upvote, how is it different?

And downvoting something is not malicious at all. If you look at it from a different perspective, it might be doing you a favor if it buries bad sellers or bad prices down the page, actually saving you from a potential scam or bad deal. 

I didnt think this was supposed to be sellers-advantaged marketplace. But maybe I was wrong. "
vc_wc,"it was in the rules. I havent looked but I guess I wouldnt be surprised if it was removed. Seeing some not great changes around here, unfortunately"
vc_wc,wow. thats actually kind of ridiculous. Who was the snowflake that caused this? We now cant downvote?
vc_wc,"The challenge is not finding the price, its people removing the price after its sold. Removing information that helps the community figure out market value. 

I have suggested that if you force a format, you could have the automod make a copy of the post that cannot be edited. that would solve the problem."

So if other people jump of a 50 story building, you would do the same? Own the choices you make, dont be a sheep. 

I didnt choose to ignore your comment, its just irrelevant. Plus, you are just choosing to be a used car salesman with that tactic. So regardless of how you acquired it, just put the fucking price you want and dont play games. But whatever.

You have been in maybe 10-20 threads total. Spare me the woe is me. At least you have won, which is more than most people. Of course it counts, but thats not what matters. There are plenty of people that cant afford to participate as much, yet they manage to contribute plenty by being friendly and engaging, so its not about the money - its about the attitude. You are getting all defensive because you know its right, and the only guy here defending you is your buddy.

I am calling it greed because thats what it appears. You can choose to bring it back to the community but you prefer here. But then you also choose to go over the value. So yeah, its greed. Now, I dont think greed is inherently bad, so thats not my issue with it, the issue is you didnt give a chance to others in the community. Its a funny way of showing you want to be a part of it. 

At the end of the day I dont really care. You can do whatever you want, but dont cry when people call you out. You made a choice, own it and live with it. "

Wishful thinking I see"
vc_wc,"I think you are not getting the frustration. 

You got this item valued at %x on a specific sub. Congratulations. 
Now you could go back to that sub and give everyone there a chance at it. That would be the right thing to do IMO, at least if you want to be a part of the community and not just a hit and run dude. 

So, it strikes me as greed to try to squeeze as much as you can from an item. Its not a bad thing but it is greed. Of course you dont owe anyone here anything. And we both know you couldnt pull that off in the other sub. If anything, that just explains why you are here rather than there. 

Good luck though, and while I am always happy to see people get these cool watches, attitudes like these really ruin it for everyone. "
vc_wc,"Well, you can look at it from a different perspective.

There is a community that should remain unnamed. Its a pretty good community with a lot of trust and camaraderie. Part of what makes that community great, is that everyone contributes one way or another. As such, we look bad at those that come in to just take advantage.

So, OP could go back to that community and accomplish this same goal and get ""full value"" if he just waited a few days. But greed takes the best of him and he is here instead. Thats not very community friendly and now how you contribute.

When it happens over and over again, I think its fair to comment on it. So yeah, good luck to OP, hope nobody bites on it as he is pricing above market value and could do the right thing and give those that allowed him to acquire it, a chance to get it for themselves.

I just got the LHD back from service, but when i had it, it was in heavy rotation. That bracelet is just so comfortable."

**Description:**|From the [original raffle](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchURaffle/comments/a1xg16/rolex_16570_polar_explorer_on_rolex_oysterflex/): The Oysterflex is not an injection-molded rubber strap, but instead a two-piece titanium bracelet with a rubber coating.‚Äù This OysterFlex bracelet is in great condition with no nicks or dents in the rubber. It is incredibly comfortable and fits all 20mm Rolex pieces. Size wise, this fits like a Rolex bracelet with 6 links on one side and 5 on the other. You have a bit of slack with an EasyLink clasp and quite a bit more slack with a Glidelock clasp. This is a case of YMMV but your AD should be able to order you replacement pieces if you need a smaller or bigger side and will have to give them the one that does not fit as they can be ordered as exchange parts I have personally tried it on my brand new Submariner 114060, and this 16570 Polar Explorer II with the PCL end links that are included. Two sets of said end links are included and were originally purchased from smartyjones on TRF who has been selling these for a long time and does a phenomenal job with them. I have never tried the brushed ones.

**Description:**|Up for raffle is my beloved 2016 Omega Speedmaster CK2998 ‚ÄúBlue Panda‚Äù. Watch was AD purchased (warranty card June 2017) and comes complete with inner and outer boxes, manuals, card wallet, LE certificate, and hangtag. I wore this watch primarily in rotation on the Omega 1565 bracelet (~$800 from the boutique) ‚Äì the OE blue gator strap was worn maybe twice and is included with the purchase. Note: springbars for the strap and bracelet are different. Watch is in very good overall condition and is running at +3s/day per my watchmaker‚Äôs timegrapher. Minor wear on the bracelet and a scratch mark from where the boutique tech‚Äôs tool slipped when installing the bracelet (facepalm). I tried my best to highlight these in the photos. Case and bezel are mint and the watch has never been polished. A gorgeous timepiece that gets tons of compliments and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll regret selling it. Sadly I‚Äôm chasing a grail and need to follow my self imposed ‚Äúone in, one out‚Äù rule.""

**Description:**|For your consideration is a discontinued Brown Lizard Wolf Triple Watch Winder with a phenomenal storage drawer. I received this as a Christmas present that I cannot seem to find much use for other than storage considering I only have manual winds. I used the first Winder from the left a handful of times when I still owned a Vintage Omega automatic, to see how the Winder functioned. The condition is flawless. The Winder sat on my desk for a few weeks before I put it back in the box. Comes with all international plugs, cord, warranty card, manuals etc, and a key to lock the case. 21‚Äù length, 11‚Äù wide, 10‚Äù high.
From the website:**|Taking design, function and attention to detail to a new level, this triple winder with storage is meticulously hand-crafted of brown pebble grain leather. The hardware is chrome-plated and the lining is a brown ultra-suede. Access to the winder is through a space saving, rotating pocket door that is cleverly engineered to slide under the base of the winder and openly display the beauty of the timepiece, held securely in place with the WOLF patented lock-in cuff. Additional space for five watches and accessories can be found inside an inconspicuous pull-out drawer. Due to the slim profile of the drawer for mechanical watches please ensure that the strap or bracelet of the watch is closed tightly around the cuff, for larger bracelets, remove the cuff completely.
**Features:**|Rotation Options: Can be set between 300 and 1200 TPD (turns per day). Double the amount of TPD by selecting bi-directional. Directional Settings: Clockwise, Counter Clockwise and Bi-directional. Delayed Program Starts: Start delay options from 6 hours to 72 hours. Watch Cuff: The cuff has been designed to fit bigger and heavier watches (up to 52mm case). The new design ‚Äúlocks‚Äù the cuff into the rotator drum for a secure fit. Battery Options: Option to run the unit on AC power (universal adapter included) or D-Cell/Lithium batteries. Storage: 3 winding modules, 5 piece watch storage (cuff will accommodate up to 52mm case) and travel case. Other: Locking glass cover and backlit LCD display

**Description:**| We got here the oldest continually produce chronograph, the Navitimer series. This is the Old Navitimer II. It is only 41mm with a sapphire crystal and has the Breitling 13 caliber, which is based on the Valjoux 7750 which makes it easy and affordbale to service and has a 42 hour powere reserve. This watch has a bidirectional bezel with every function you need to be able to be an imaginary pilot while sitting in your office trying to find ways to calculate your expense report on your watch. As some say: ""This watch is wearable, historically significant, complicated and if you struggle with basic math it can (be extremely helpful) assist in those matters as well. It‚Äôs undoubtedly a significant piece of aviation and horology history, while also considered by some as a romantic piece of a bygone era."" Picked this up on a whim, I do not have service history, box or papers. But it does have the very sought after and expensive bracelet.

vc_wc,You do delivery?
vc_wc,With all the money they make off this place I don't understand why they can't hire more mods for the weekends. It's just pure greed!
vc_wc,"Well said man, that's only one part of it, the other is all the comments leading up to it.

I have been extra hard on him because he just doesn't get it. 

The fact that he has to be shamed into offering just shows you that the spirit is not there.  And that's just saddening beyond this specific example. 

First we are rigged and then a $10k win is apparently not good enough. "
vc_wc,"Those good hearted members must have not seen all your comments accusing us of running a rigged system. Or maybe they don't know you have been tracking their IP address. Maybe you should show those comments to them and ask how much they spent and how they feel about you running your mouth and being ungrateful about a huge win. 

I'll say it again, you owe us all an apology.

And yeah I take it personally.  We are nothing but accepting of new people, and we are one of the most supporting communities. but don't look kindly to those accusing us and you have not contributed anything to have any right to run your mouth"
vc_wc,Do you have any other conspiracy theories? 
vc_wc,"Yes we can blame you for being an idiot. How do you feel about it now? 

Oh there are other people that think the same? Then they are idiots by believing that but keep putting money into it. 

Are you going to tell everyone in every meta how much you spent and how much you won the same way you asked every winner?

You owe everyone an apology. There couldn't have been a less deserving a winner, but I guess it's proof its not rigged, huh?

vc_wc,"you know whats worse than a whiny winner? a welcher

so winning a $10k watch on 2 spots is not good enough for you?

You know why you are downvoted to hell? look around at the history of the community. We all buy spots for each other, give stuff for free, and in general are generous and kind to each other. 

Of course you dont have to get him a watch and im sure he would prob reject it. But I guarantee you that anyone else would have been kind enough to say something and offer something; even if it was not the same watch. Your lack of gratitude after winning such a great watch is really telling. "
vc_wc,"Are you shitting me? we are toxic?

Says the guy that won a $10 watch in 2 spots and everyone else paid for it? The same guy that claimed this was a conspiracy? and the same guy that was literally stalking others about how much they spent and won?

You must be the guy thats asks people how much they make IRL and how much they paid for everything they have. 

Give it a break and get your tinfoil hat on. People are downvoting you cause they are salty as they would have like to win. Go look how many winners get upvoted. Grow a pair.

You know whats worse than an entitled winner? a whiny winner.

How about you say thank you and contribute to the community beyond creating conspiracy theories?"

**Description:**|Up for sale is a 1986 Rolex GMT Master Two Tone 16753. The set includes the box, manual, polishing cloth, and most obviously the watch on a two tone bracelet. The 24hr Dial sticks a tiny bit when turning and there are signs of wear that are consistent with age. However, it has not been polished and the bracelet still clasps very well. It's currently sized for a 7"" wrist and I have all the original extra links. It will easily fit up to 7.5"". I will ship internationally if buyer pays the overage.

**Description:**|Won in a raffle a few months back. Keeps great time, and I have not encountered any date change issues. Some desk diving marks on the clasp, but otherwise in great condition. **From previous raffle [$3900](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchURaffle/comments/9ii5og/tudor_black_bay_pepsi_gmt_ref_79830rb_100_39/):** Its been worn a couple times to an office, but doesn't show any additional wear. This is the bracelet version with the full kit. I also kept this wound and timed it over 8-9 days, it was around +1.5s a day without being worn, and the main reason I kept it running was to check and see if I saw the date change issue, which I didn't. No issues with date changing and it kept great time. [Previously raffled for $4500](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchURaffle/comments/8wmykw/tudor_black_bay_pepsi_gmt_100_spots_at_45ea_with/)

vc_wc,lmao there was no push off
vc_wc,but pats d cant pressure
vc_wc,"Thats what i meant and I stand corrected, the original comment was deleted, but some comments in the thread were removed (for good reasons)"
vc_wc,"We'll agree to disagree. The post was deleted, actually looks like it was removed by the mods, which is disappointing by /u/zeroair

&gt; 265$ in mods? I'd consider lowering the price.
&gt; 
&gt; 450 (asking price) - 185 (retail price) = 265 (mods price)

I dont think that was even a bad comment - it was not ""shitting"" on the OP at all. It is definitely a helpful comment IMO to buyers that may not know much. And I am not saying the price was bad, i know nothing about Seikos. 

But i do think the onus is on the seller to provide information. If i was the seller and that comment was made, i would reply similar to how you did, with information about the cost of the mods and labor. And thats that. People will read it and understand, or they wont. But what is with the censoring? I think thats bullshit.

If this commenter had personally attacked him, implied the item was fake, or was truly shitty to OP then I would agree. But we should be free to provide feedback, and saying ""hey you may want to rethink your price"" is fair feedback.

There are 2 types of sellers. Those that get butthurt about stuff like this and those that provide information and a proper answer to people's concerns. IDK how hard would it have been for OP to say, these are the mods, this is how much they cost, labor was $x. I feel its fair to ask for $y.
"
vc_wc,Tag
vc_wc,"There are many ways in which people have concerns about an item beyond price, and yeah those should be voiced. Is not shitting on someone. 

I honestly have not seen or noticed people shitting on someone else without any backing or valid concerns. 

So what is the reasoning those comments should go? hurt feelings?

if you are an up and up seller, have done a good job describing your item, and have a fair price I have hard time seeing how comments hurt you.

Are buyers idiots? Because i really dont care what most people that post have to say about something, only the opinions of those i trust. So I look at an item and i make my own choice whether to engage the seller, or pass. 

Eliminating comments is a terrible idea"
vc_wc,"I think that it is hard to differentiate what is trolling vs what is a valid challenge. 

In any case, the OP should be able to deal with it on his own.

My point is that we dont need a rule or enforcement to eliminate comments. That would be the wrong direction for this sub IMO."
vc_wc,"I get the idea, but we are also seeing a lot of crap from being on watchrecon. We are also seeing a lot of scammers and have had some success here because the userbase was not accustomed to the traffic from watchrecon. 

Tough balance. I prefer to be safer and smaller, than allow all the crap from watchrecon to come here. If i wanted to deal with that I would go to WUS, TRF, and TZ."
vc_wc,tag /u/zeroair to change the automod. I think it makes sense to disable in the WTB
vc_wc,"I dont know what you are asking exactly, the answer is because its not. I mean, i agree with you that we should, but thats never been a rule. But you are asking why the mod decided at one point to do whatever? I mean he probably doesnt even fucking know why.

If you are trying to suggest that it **should be a requirement to put price in post title** then you got my vote. "
vc_wc,"As others have said, because of scams and fraud.

I buy the seller, and if I am selling I have built a positive reputation so that a buyer can ""buy"" me as well.

I will only allow a buyer with great rep to pay G&amp;S, but at that point why would they spend the extra 3% if they trust me. 

On the other hand, if I am buying the seller and I trust him - I have no problem paying f&amp;f first and getting the item. If their rep is not up to snuff cause they are new, then they can ship the item first and I'll pay after i receive. If that doesnt work, then it doesnt work. There are plenty of watches in the world, no need to take risks for no reason. If good prices look too good to be true, then they are."
vc_wc,"And we can provide proof that their shit is overpriced, it goes both ways, and its in the rules.

I dont know what you are referring to specifically so i cant speak to sum of parts, etc. 

If you prefer eBay then go for it. I know i much rather sell here as I dont enjoy paying listing fees and commissions when you could deal with private buyers 1 on 1. 
"
vc_wc,"I disagree completely with this, If you just want to take the price a seller posts at face value, then go to any of the other forums that dont allow comments on sale posts. 

I like to browse and sell/buy here because you are able to have comment and interact with seller in a public forum and not just through PMs. 

The rules say seller can post whatever price they want, but also allows others to challenge pricing as long as they have a source.

If your issue is with unfounded challenging, then fine, challenge whoever is doing it in the thread. 

But im not bending backwards because shitty sellers try to push overpriced shit here. And i dont meant folks that are a few hundred on either side; i mean those that are trying pull one over the community. If you know a bunch of people that have nice watches but are too pussy or scared to post here then im for one glad they are not pushing their overpriced stuff here."

**Description:**|Won in a raffle a few months ago. Is in overall good condition, and keeps great time. Some small scuff marks around the bezel, and some scuff marks on bracelet and clasp. Comes with an unopened camo strap.**From previous raffle:** Nearly new in box, worn a handful of times. The gorgeous Tudor Black Bay 36. Features double locking stainless steel bracelet, tudor urban camo NATO, extra link and warranty dated 3/22/18. All boxes &amp; papers. Only scuffs you will find are some very minor ones on clasp and link near clasp due to desk-diving, other than that watch is like new, which I'd rate 99%. Bracelet has never been taken off watch head. See photos for more detail. Watch features extremely bright lume on all 12 indices &amp; all 3 snowflake hands, screw down embossed crown, 100m WR and glossy black dial which encapsulate each indice in a steel ring.

**Description:**|Up for raffle is a BNIB unworn SBGN001 with tags and a stamped warranty card, ready to fill your name. This is a limited edition of 800 and it was created to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the revolutionary 9F quartz movement. It‚Äôs rated to +5/-5 seconds a year, 39mm case size, 46mm lug to lug, 12mm height. 19mm lug width. The movement functions like an Explorer II or GMT Master II so the third crown position jumps the hour hand so you can set the local time when changing time zones or daylight savings without having to set the watch. I have shamelessly borrowed info from the 2 prior raffles and some images to showcase the watch.

**Description:**|Up for raffle, I have a captivating and like new Jaeger-LeCoultre Polaris automatic in stainless steel (ref# 9008170). The JLC watch is pristine with a few faint hairline scratches, really only on the polished clasp. Could pretty much pass as new. The watch was purchased less than a few weeks ago and there's plenty of warranty left on it. This watch features a 41mm case, an inner rotation rehaut, and a transparent caseback showcasing the 898e/1 movement. You don't see many of these on a stainless steel bracelet, which IMO, is better because, not only is it stunning, but the price for buying a leather strap is much cheaper than the bracelet separately. My favorite part is the intricacy of the dial. It has a subtle sunburst in the middle, a matte like finish where the indices are, and then a satin finish for the inner bezel. Watch comes with box, papers, and everything you'd expect as if purchasing from AD. Missing the outer box, but it really just houses the inner JLC presentation box.

vc_wc,"At least for BMW, any dealer will take a lease return. The car belongs to BMW/BMWFS and I believe the receiving dealer gets first dibs on taking it for re-sale.

The way it was explained to me by a dealer friend, receiving dealer gets first dibs, if they decline, they go to a BMW dealer only auction, if nobody picks it up then it goes to general auction.

I suspect is pretty similar for other automakers. "

**Name:**|Tag Heuer Autavia ""Jo Siffert"" Re-Edition Cal. 11 Ref. CY2110
--:|:--
**Price:**|$2500
**Description:**|I personally think this is a very attractive watch.. The crown on the left and the blue accents are cool; just a little different type of Autavia. Now, I have no service history but it runs well, the crown feels smooth when seting date/time, and the dial and hands look really great. The case has signs of wear but nothing deep, the brushed and polished finishes look great with minor hairline scratches that can be easily cleared out. The bezel has 2 very small marks at the edge, but thats all I have seen. The bracelet has 11 full and 1 half link. Watch is 42mm in diameter with a sapphire crystal. The movement is a Calibre 11. Please look at the pictures for signs of wear, nothing deep and has not been polished with all edges super sharp. 
**What's Included**|Watch, bracelet with 11 full and 1 half link
**Payment method**|PAYPAL
**Location** |NY, USA  
**Shipping Method**|Insured and Signature required
**Anything Else?**|Looking to sell first, but definitely open to trades, up or down, down to multiples + cash also possible. I just have too many chronos

**Description:**|This is a very clean example of an Omega Speedmaster 3575.20 full kit. This watch offers a lot. Having a date function, chronograph, and a Moonphase indicator.  Crystal is flawless. Bezel has a slight ding directly above the ‚ÄúR‚Äù in TACHY. and also at the ‚Äú110‚Äù point. Case is in excellent condition, noting only a light scratch between the pushers on the left side. Bracelet has light marks that can be seen in correct lighting from daily wear, mainly on the outside of the wrist. Clasp has light desk diving marks. Fits a 7.25 inch wrist. These links can be found on eBay fairly cheap and can also be purchased at any Omega Boutique as well. Everything functions as it should. Chrono resets to zero. Has a great power reserve of 48+ hours. This timepiece has went through a 6-point inspection by a technician at an Omega Boutique. At the boutique they basically look at the condition of everything (hands, crystal, dial, pushers, case, bracelet, etc) and evaluate the condition and look at the movement. The technician said the movement looked great and did not need a service for a few years to come. Everything was properly oiled. The buyer will receive the paperwork. You may notice two little pushers on the left side of the case. These are used to set the Moonphase and date functions. The Moonphase function is pretty extraordinary. When set correctly, it is spot on. Walk outside, look up at the moon, check your wrist and it will match. Blued hour markers glisten in the light. One of the more rare models of Speedmasters. This was my first Omega timepiece and I have taken very good care of it. Hoping to find it a good home.

**Description:**|This comes with all the box/papers, plus an unworn strap and unworn black Tudor nato. It is in nearly perfect condition with just some strap change marks and some other minor imperfections from daily wear. I can't get pictures of the marks because they are so small, but it isn't perfect. It is in wearable condition. I have heard people say the Black with a Strap on the warranty card is the rarest/hardest of the Black Bays to find. Keeps great time (2-5 seconds a day). Only made for about 6 months with the ETA and the rose logo on the dial. This is a bit thinner than the in house and in my opinion much prettier with the rose instead of the shield. John Mayer and Fred Savage both own this watch, you could too!!! Hodinkee has some great articles on this watch and I mean it is beautiful! Watch only comes with the 2 tudor straps (not the leather nato or rally strap).

I would guess this should probably be priced similarly, given that its not moving at that price shows the market is unwilling to pay for it.

vc_wc,I am still waiting for /u/ronindog to call the rest or for /u/stevieknicks to call 20% or maybe /u/amnonymous will want another win
vc_wc,"The $1283 you have listed, was brand new, and yours isnt. All the high comps on ebay are for new items. 

Seriously man, this doesnt take a lot of effort, there are a ton of comps on this item. Which tells me that either you are being terribly lazy or you are trying to gouge the community. Im leaning the latter.

Your ""conceding"" on this one is not good enough. Based on the comps you should be at $1000 max. Your original price was 27% higher and your new price is still 12% too high. "
vc_wc,"Well actually I did cherrypick them and I said that at the bottom of my post. I dont expect you to sell at the bottom.

You are right, but as the rules say below, we as a community may raise concerns. If you are going to add shipping, should we deduct ebay fees from the price? Yeah I dont think so. 

&gt; NM and Blue NM: Community may raise concerns in the QUEUE and OP MUST respond. Raffle is on hold until pricing issue resolved. If OP adjusts pricing to satisfaction of community, announcement timer resets to the time price was modified. If there are still issues or OP does not adjust, raffle may not run until mods set price and approve. Announcement timer resets to the time mods approve it.

You can do whatever you want, and its prob a very small adjustment anyway, but the better comps are the 2 sold privately via /r/watchexchange. "
vc_wc,"I'd like a tag as well, /u/ct139 not trying to be a dick here, but its pretty obvious when people cherry pick the high comps instead of being transparent. The 2 highest ones you posted are 2 weeks old, which is very different than 2+ years old.

I am not saying there are some others sold for more (although they are only 2 weeks old and under warranty) but some transparency would go a long way for people to make an educated decision on whether to buy in or not or if the price should be adjusted. "

**Description:**|I got a little trigger happy and won this along with a few other items and figured I would pass it along. I personally think its a very attractive watch, but not everyone agrees. The crown on the left and the blue accents are cool; just a little different type of Autavia. Now, I have no service history but it runs well, the crown feels smooth when seting date/time, and the dial and hands look really great. The case has signs of wear but nothing deep, the brushed and polished finishes look great with minor hairline scratches that can be easily cleared out. The bezel has 2 very small marks at the edge, but thats all I have seen. The bracelet has 11 full and 1 half link. Watch is 42mm in diameter with a sapphire crystal. The movement is a Calibre 11.

#Edit

**/u/EliRulez found some comps and I found another one, including them here:**

* [~~$3400~~ Looks like $2500 Best offer accepted - 2016 warranty](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Breitling-Superocean-44-Special-M17393-Original-Box-Paperwork-/223254980384)

* [$3585 unknown warranty](https://www.ebay.com/itm/BLACK-STEEL-CERAMIC-BREITLING-SUPEROCEAN-44-SPECIAL-DATE-WATCH-M17393-44MM-/392177671603)

* [$2900 - 2016 warranty](https://www.ebay.com/itm/254041285549)

* [$2500 really worn / unsold / on some Nato/rubber](https://www.ebay.com/itm/273619972004?ul_noapp=true)

I am leaving it to OP to adjust pricing if he sees fit or if the community proposes a price based on comps found. My personal (not binding and not really important) opinion is that if you take the 3 sold comps and average them, it comes to $2995. I would consider that this is LNIB with almost full warranty. 

#Edit #2: price updated to $2700 @ 6pm Friday"

**Item Name:**|Omega Seamaster Plane Ocean 2201.50 with Omega 1120 Movement
--:|:--
**Price:**|$2,000
**# of Spots:**|100
**Price Justification:**|$1,900 prior raffle here (without the Omega Bond Nato I purchased and have added to this raffle) https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchURaffle/comments/9j3477/blue_nm_omega_seamaster_planet_ocean_220150_100/?st=JQ795PQW&amp;sh=a5ccbe42
**Price Justification:**|As was the case with the prior raffle, it is hard to price this watch given the customization.  The $2,000 price is $100 more than the prior raffle and is reflective of my adding an Omega Bond nato strap (purchased at an Omega boutique for $160 in October).  I only wore this watch for a total of about 10 days since receiving it as it joined a collection that contains other watches I wear more frequently (and as a result I am re-raffling it).  The rubber strap that came with the prior raffle is also included.  Please see attached photos for all that‚Äôs included.

**Description:**|Omega Seamaster Professional Planet Ocean Model 2201.50, 42mm with stainless case with brushed sides and polished top finishes.  Black bezel insert with silver numbers.  Black dial - lume markers are whiteish/green in color - no discoloration or fading. Excellent lume, second hand is bright red - no fading.  This watch no longer has the original 2500 co-axial movement. Exelonman (from watchuseek) wanted to build a long running and reliable 1120 powered Planet Ocean as he had never seen it accomplished and made the custom modification.  He then sold it on WUS (if you google his name, 2201.50 and 1120, you‚Äôll see the listing). All other parts are genuine Omega items that are original to a 42mm Planet Ocean: Dial, Hands, Stem, Crown, Case, Caseback, Crystal, Bezel. Automatic Omega 1120 Currently running within around -/+ 5 seconds every 24 hours. It was serviced a few months ago in July (receipt included).  The date issue noted in the prior raffle has not been observed in the three months I‚Äôve kept this watch.  attempts to change when unscrewing the screw-down crown. This is a common issue in 1120 movements but does not take away from the reliability of the movement. The bezel insert is near mint with no visible marks to my eyes. Bezel assembly is near mint with a scratch at the 17 minute mark. Crystal is scratch free. I see no marks in the anti-reflective coating. Case is near mint with a few light marks on sides and the polished lugs. There are some light handling marks on the hands from service, but those are not visible during normal wear. Case appears to be original finish.

vc_wc,hey thanks man! 
vc_wc,"This is a question for the mods, what are the plans for enforcing leaving the price on the OP after an item is sold?

Right now I see a few folks that point it out to the OP, a few update it back and others are just snarky or ignore. 

It's frustrating to see that the most common violators are dealers and people that move several pieces.

I have said it before and I insist that there are 2 options for this: a) price must be in the title, b) have automod reply to the OP with a copy of the text. This allows the original to be preserved for posterity.

Now, if those are not good options, it should at least be enforced. If an OP did asked to put the price sold, and they don't do it, nothing happens. 

It's the least enforced rule in the whole sub and frustrating when you are trying to gauge market value based on past recent sales. "

vc_wc,"First, your apologetic comment did not come across as apologetic, but as just making excuses for a shitty action. I think she figured pretty quickly how to participate in paid raffles and giveaways, so i would think its not that difficult to post here.  I didnt call her toxic.

I didnt send a message on ebay, so that was not me. But I did submit an offer to buy it now that I thought was fair but it was auto rejected. 

My goal was not to make her feel like an asshole, but to call out what is an asshole move. One doesnt equal the other.  Youa re telling me its not assholish to post here about how much you love the win, people wishing you well and congrats, and then quietly and sneakily going out to ebay to post it for sale? As i said elsewhere, i dont care if you sell it. Its yours to do as you please. And really, you should sell it wherever you like for as much as you'd like, but we also have the right to call it out. And honestly, if she is new, YOU should have known better. Maybe KR doesnt have the same sense of community but you have still be around enough to know. So the ignorance bit doesnt really fly. 

Actually, it is not full time. I wish they gave me benefits. Just part time. And i didnt find the link to ebay, other people did. And check my info, i am not one hunting down people being a dick around the sub. 

I dont want to know why, as i said, you can do whatever you want. The point here is that it would have been nice to give us all here a chance to win it. And if you just hate the sub and want to sell elsewhere then fine, say that. Or say nothing. Not the lame excuses you gave above.  In the end it doesnt matter, me posting here and calling out something i think is wrong, **is not meant to have any negative impact whatsoever either**. 

Yeah, maybe you dont know the feeling, but there are people here that are 0/400 in raffles. Seeing someone else win and then take it elsewhere is not a great feeling. I know winning on your first chance must be a great feeling and shocking. But there are two sides, and my comment was about the other side. I never asked you to explain why you selling it, just to explain why not sell it here so we, those that contributed to that great win, get a chance again to win it. Just like its a lot of money to you, its a lot of money for someone to try to buy it on ebay, so they would prefer to take a shot at it here for the cost of 1 spot and maybe win it, just like you did.

My feathers were not ~~raffled~~ ruffled. You are not the first one nor will be the last one that does this. Some people get it, some people dont.  No hard feelings from my end, i just know that if you win that watch is unlikely to come back. Enjoy the sub, its a great community and we would like to keep it that way."

Just as easy as it was to post a picture of it, it would be easy to post a comment here asking:

* ""i love it but i could use the cash, what should i do?"" 

* ""Hey if i wanted to raffle it, how do i go about it?""

* ""Anyone interested in possibly buying it?""

Some support? Support for what? She or you didnt post here at all, instead went straight to ebay. Shit, ebay is harder to navigate that this sub. 

She was pressured to sell? LOL ok. I dont care if you sell it, but could have been just as easily be sold here. But she wants to keep the watch? so which is it?

I am the last one to beat on a noob, but this shit is really poor form. And she couldnt even post herself? At least give us a valid reason and stand by your decision.

One way to contribute is to give us a chance to win stuff we missed on and that we put money into. I never get why take a win and sell it elsewhere as if its not going to be noticed.

**Description:**|Catch and release for me. I have been on the hunt for one of these for a while, finally picked one up, and it doesn't vibe with me like I hoped it would. Good condition, with some desk diving marks on the bracelet, a couple of hard to see scuffs on the bezel, perfect crystal, movement running strong and keeping good time, winds buttery smooth, warranty card dated 1/18/18 from an AD. Full kit, including three spare links, two hang tags, booklets, warranty card, inner/outer boxes, unworn NATO all included. Note that the price is higher than last week's, but this includes a bracelet which goes for about $500-600.

**Description:**|This is a gorgeous chronograph from Glash√ºtte Original. Its a 40mm steel case with a sapphire crystal. The dial is a silver/white color that has really warm tones, maybe its the lighting I use, but in the pictures it looks kind of tan/beige and in person it has a bit of that hue as well nut not as pronounced. The dial has a seconds subdial, as well as a center seconds hand, a 30min, and 6-hour subdials for the chronograph. This watch has a gorgeous in-house movement that can be seen through the screw-down display caseback. As you can see the movement, it is well decorated as you would expect from GO, it has skeletonized rotor with the GO logo, a gold flywheel and swan neck regulator. This is a 51 jewel movement. The watch comes with the original Louisiana Crocodile leather strap and GO buckle as pictured. This watch was bought in Hong Kong and getting the original strap into the USA was a total ordeal. Pointing out pricing from overseas for a few reasons - first there would be custom and duties, but getting the original crocodile leather band into the US was painful and expensive, I spent a little over $300 to get it - and most sellers wont send it or you risk getting the whole package stuck at the border.

**Description:**|**Vintage Omega Automatic Linen Dial:** First listing is a vintage men's dress watch made by Omega ref 166.002. The watch features a stainless steel case that has not been over-polished. The case shows wear consistent with its age. The watch was worn on a stretch bracelet and shows some wear to the inside of the lugs, but this does not effect the watch in any way other than asthetically. This watch contains the rare Omega caliber 560 movement, of which only 3000 were made. Omega was following suit of other manufacturers at this time, and created the 560 to save on tariffs when exporting watches to be sold in the United States. Once delivered, the watch was cased by Omega's American importer, Norman Morris. This specific watch is a non collection piece, and has the correct dial and case for such a watch. The linen dial shows some minor patina, but is acceptable and provides a lovely warm tone for the watch. The applied metal logo is a nice touch on these older Omega watches. Worth noting, is the new aftermarket crystal and reflector ring. This ring covers a slight bit more of the dial and as such where it is marked ""SWISS"" on the bottom cannot be seen, but it is present. Hands appear to be in good condition and free from any major corrosion, the same can be said for the applied hour markers. The case is marked with the reference and also with ""SGR"" in a shield which denotes Graber S.A. as the manufacturer. The crown was replaced during a prior service and while unsigned, functions just fine. This watch has been serviced by my watchmaker and as such will come with a 6 month warranty on function. The watch is keeping time accurately and functions as it should. Watch comes on a new X leather strap. This is a fully serviced vintage dress watch in stainless steel and linen dial with applied logo.
**Description:**|**Vintage Omega Geneve Automatic Day Date:** The second listing is a vintage men's watch made by Omega for it's Geneve line, ref 166.0173. The watch features a stainless steel case in better than average condition. The watch comes on it's original Omega bracelet, which is the 1168 (the same bracelet used on the extremely rare Apollo-Soyuz Speedmaster). Including is extra links, when added should fit a wrist larger than 7.5 inches. The watch contains Omega caliber 1012 movement, one of the last automatic movements Omega designed before the quartz crisis. The watch shows some wear near the center of the dial. Hands appear to be in good condition and free from any major corrosion or damage. The crown is an original Omega crown replaced during service. This watch has been serviced by my watchmaker and as such will come with a 6 month warranty on function. The watch is keeping time accurately and functions as it should. A decent Omega watch that would make a great beater or first Omega for someone.

**Description:**|Up for sale today is the Nomos Tangente 39 Silvercut.  I won this in a previous raffle and only worn it once since I've had this in my possession. Comes in the same condition as I received. 
**Notes from raffle:**:|This beautiful piece was purchased through another redditor that won the piece and has been lightly worn for two months in rotation with several other pieces. Piece is still under warranty (Bought Mar 2018). This piece comes with box, case, and warranty info. There is a slight scratch on the back of the watch case by the bottom lugs from when I bought it, macro shot here: https://imgur.com/sSeLpWI this is hardly noticeable unless you really look for it.

**Description:**|Easy to sport around on the daily or save for the dressier occasions. The watch comes with the original inner and outer box and the Tudor issued booklet, however the warranty card is gone. This watch comes with the a brand new Tudor Tan Leather Strap with Tudor Branded Deployment Clasp, as well as the Tudor issued Camo Nato Strap. There is very minimal signs of use and only a minor scratch on the bezel aaround the 4 hour mark. 
The case back has a few snags around the lugs from changing straps
Overall, this watch is in 95% condition and the stainless steel definitely shines.

**Description:**|For sale is my Rolex Sub 14060M, which most of us are familiar with. This has never been polished, as shown by the still very sharp lugs and very visible chamfers. The watch is overall in amazing condition with a perfect crystal, bezel, and dial. The bracelet has minimal desk diving marks (photos taken specifically to showcase these, but in person it's hard to tell there's a single scratch on it). Polished case sides show some micro scratching. Original case back sticker intact. Movement running strong with a good power reserve. The guy I bought it off of claims to have had it serviced four years ago. It winds beautifully and keeps good time, so I have no reason to doubt that. However, I make no claims about its service history or accuracy or water resistance rating since I wasn't the one who had it serviced. Typical ""Rolex click"" while winding, and the overwind clutch works as well.

**Description:**|Offered up is a reference 145.014 Omega Speedmaster Mark II. This watch has been restored in a joint effort by Tanner at TMWatchcompany and my watchmaker. The stainless steel case has been completely restored to correct Omega factory specifications and is nearly flawless, with only very minor marks from wear. There are some marks present near the hippocampus on the case back. Dial is the correct Mark II signed dial in good condition, the dial has turned a tropical brown color and the lume has aged as well. The watch has the original flat foot signed Omega crown that has been rebuilt with new gaskets, the pushers are also original and have been rebuilt. The crystal is a sapphire replacement and will not scratch like the original mineral examples are prone to. Hands are original to the watch and contain the luminous material, except the hour subdial hand which is a replacement. This watch has been serviced by my watchmaker in August and as such will come with the remainder of a 12 month warranty on function. The watch is keeping time accurately and functions as it should, chronograph resets to zero. Movement is bright and shiny and problem free, it is the same caliber 861 as the moonwatch. Watch will come with it's original 1159 bracelet which was refinished to match the case. This rare bracelet was only offered for a few years before being replaced by a different model. Bracelet has some stretch but is better than average and is free from damage and measures 6.25"" long without the watch attached.
**Extras:**|As an addition is a like NOS Holzer Mexican bracelet for the Speedmaster Mark II. I preferred the look of this bracelet and wore the watch on it instead of the 1159. Clasp is marked with ""80"" for 1980 and will fit about an 8 inch wrist when attached to a watch. This bracelet is valued at $400.

vc_wc,"I rented one of those for $1500/mo for 3 months while I looked in the area. It was private entrance but super small. 

But that was all that was available on a short term. None of the actual apartments would take a 3 month lease. 

You are not exaggerating in the conditions for lease either. I ended up paying the 3 months upfront.  In the end it worked out, it was 10 hours work days, go for a beer and dinner, and any free time was driving around looking at areas to live in, and only went there to sleep. "
vc_wc,"Port Chester should be higher on this list. 

Easy and fast commute to White plains at both rush hours, traffic really starts in the border with Connecticut. I do it every day to Rye Brook and it takes less than 15 mins each way. 

Great food and a semblance of night life, and even if you prefer something else both White plains and Greenwich/Stanford/Norwalk are close by.

If you want to go into the city, train is super accessible with plenty of parking and a fairly quick ride, express trains are also available.

I would just add that although unlikely, the are old high karma accounts available for sale so not a fool proof measure. "
vc_wc,"&gt; Strictly speaking, that's not really true.... It is true that we don't manually approve every post. We don't even have to see every post generally, because the rules are set up that way. That was our work that made it happen. Just want to be sure you know that we do stuff here, and are quite active even though you might not always see what we do.

Perhaps my comment came across more pointed than I intended. I'm not implying mods don't work, the setup and rules were set by design to work this way.

My comment was more to point out that the self regulated setup that had worked well may not hold up so well in the context of the increased traffic and visibility. 

&gt; For enforcing what, exactly? The rules as they are, are enforced at least daily (ie, the modqueue is clean daily). If you are suggesting that we move to a fully moderated model, which means that every post sits in the modqueue before the mods confirm then approve it, that's something we can look into. I am sure you'll agree that's not ideal.

Definitely not suggesting every post is approved, but perhaps mods should attempt to look at more posts. Yes, that may be a lot, but relying 100% on users reporting and only dealing with mod queue might not work nowadays. 

My above comment points to this, there is a lot more self regulation than mod involvement. This has the tendency to turn threads into vigilante justice, unproductive discussion, chasing people out, or just letting things go until it's too late and people have been scammed. 

I understand why this was done and would agree but perhaps it's too reliant on users.

&gt; Absolutely into that. But what exactly do you recommend? That's the whole point of the weekly META!

I think there are a few ideas, some of which may not be popular:

* Price must be posted in the title. Discounts could be flaired. 

* Every post should be an image otherwise automoderator could unapprove

* Other forums have it, a minimum post count could help remove listings

* Deleting posts should trigger negative feedback.

* Standardizing posts, and enforcing it, would help. Incomplete post should automatically be removed

* At a more macro level, the mod team should decide if dealers are welcome or not. And rules should be updated, I think the last thing we want is for the sub to overrun with dealers posts that can be found elsewhere

These are just top of my head and not completely thought out, but I think the point being that some more involvement from mods is welcomed and necessary.

Not to knock the mods team, I don't know them. I have only seen posts from you, that maybe by design. But more visibility of mods would help, just like having police presence deters crime, seeing mods more involved could only help. Or it might not be feasible as volume of posts increases.

vc_wc,"you should post this in the meta though, maybe someone will post one up for you"
vc_wc,There are no pictures in that link and you should really only post when you have your own pictures ready. Gwts though
vc_wc,"I offered you to pay you f&amp;f - but yiou send first. Unlike you, I have positive reputation in this sub and im not going to ruin it over $600. 

So if you really want to move this you already have my offer on the table, otherwise you are just looking to scam. "
vc_wc,"The mod activity in this sub has always been on the lighter side. It has mostly been community modded. 

And I agree with you, need more modding and another enforcement.

To be honest, probably need to revise some rules to account for the influx of dealers and noobs. The visibility from watchrecon has brought in a ton of scammers as well"
vc_wc,I got a 16 month old. I'd be down
vc_wc,Slut
vc_wc,Yeah depending on what you'd like to get for it
vc_wc,Tag

vc_wc,Yeah tag me
vc_wc,Seems high for an incomplete set. I'll take a tad though
vc_wc,I'll take #22 or random or waitlist i guess
vc_wc,Not to be the bearer of bad news but Chrono 24 is not a good source of pricing. You want to look at watchrecon and eBay. I haven't looked but I think somewhere around the $1k range is probably more likely
vc_wc,"Well deserved man, thanks for everything you do around here"
vc_wc,I want that meistersinger 
vc_wc,Ok throw me the winning randie as well
vc_wc,"I'll take #11, #22. No replacement if taken. "
vc_wc,Lol nice win congratulations!

I've had it a couple years now and just never really worn it. I bought it out of a local watch shop. Papers and box to go with it. Quick Specs: 45mm Chronograph. Automatic ETA 7750 movement. Stainless Steel Case, PVD Coated. Ceramic Bezel. Carbon Fiber Face. 100m Rating

vc_wc,"I agree that it probably will self correct. 

In the old sub, we had 2 main raffles a day, 5 days a week, that was nuts! But thats how it went and most stuff filled. But then, there were a few days where we had 1 or 2 watches in the queue - there were no sellers, and buyers were not buying. 

So yeah, if people tap out, stuff wont fill, and it will slow down the queue."

The watch is in like-new condition, worn a total of 5 days. It keeps time very well (about +3-4 seconds over 24-hours).  The watch comes with everything it was sold with, and also comes with an extra gray leather strap I bought for it that has quick deployment (see photos).

**Description:**|Introduced at Basel World 2018 this is a hard to find in stores. I purchased this November 2nd from an Authorized Dealer after being on a waitlist ever since I saw it introduced. It comes with the full kit, stamped and named warranty card dated November, 2018, which will last 5 years. The dealer removed a link for me so its sized for 7-7.25‚Äù wrists. Worn a couple days last week, the dial, lugs, bezel is flawless. The clasp has a tiny hairline scratch from my desk at work.

vc_wc,"As I said, maybe enough of them do. All I see at my local dealer are current under warranty/maintenance vehicles. So I'm guessing that's the bulk of their profit"
vc_wc,That makes sense. If they can keep the wrenches busy they all make money. Probably better than a percentage of gross. 
vc_wc,"Wonder how they calculate gross on maintenance work since the manufacturer is probably already paying a set fee for the work with very minimal margin. 

I assume there are survey bonuses and maybe other types of step bonuses? 

For a brand like BMW must be tough as few owners of out of warranty/maintenance go to the dealer. They tend to go to Indy mechanics instead. But maybe there is enough.

It's also interesting cause 100% commission can set poor incentives. "

vc_wc,"I am all for having quality pieces come through here, but also priced appropriately and not at retail prices.

I thought it was against the rules (kinda is against #2), but at the very least is frowned upon for you to not include pictures of the item, and instead link us to your business website. 

Now, you have mentioned ""value"" in the past, but here are some comps of actually recently sold examples.

* $6500 - [1986 and serviced this month](https://www.rolexforums.com/showthread.php?t=631425). A whole $2k lower represent better value IMO

* $8250 - [Never polished, full set, open 6/9](https://www.rolexforums.com/showthread.php?t=616942). $300 lower, and a full set. Better value

I am not going to link unsold, but the point is that you are getting downvoted because you are gouging buyers here. As the rules say (#9), you can price however you want, but thats where the downvotes are coming from on top of you being a retailer and pushing people to your website.

Good luck with your sales but I would recommend that if you want to have a better experience here you should consider pricing your items more attractively here than elsewhere. "

**Will ship international?**|USA/Canada only
**Timestamp/pics:**|https://imgur.com/a/TcXvQEg
**Description:**|This is probably the best bang for buck watch on the market. Highly accurate at 6 seconds gained this month. The crystal is flawless without any scratches. Ive worn it at the office for a month and it has picked up a few swirls on the bracelet and one small hairline scratch at the end link which I tried to capture in the photos. The bracelet is size for 7-7.25‚Äù and comes with 3 additional links. The previous own unfortunately lost one of the collars so 2/3 can be placed on. GS should be able to provide an additional one at minimal costs. The warranty period started July 2018 so tons of time left.

vc_wc,"Pictures is not there anymore.

We have raffled some ""ugly"" stuff before and while it has filled at times, it has struggled. I don't think you can get top dollar for it but if you are flexible, it should fill. "
vc_wc,I see it and I don't like it
vc_wc,Why you be that way bb?
vc_wc,tag me
vc_wc,tag. good price!
vc_wc,"Not at all, it looks that way because that's a really cheap perlon strap thats super thin.

Look at the pictures with the original leather strap, it actually wears more like a dress watch IMO."
vc_wc,The brown croc one is the original that came with the watch. The blue one is a cheap perlon strap that I had laying around. 
vc_wc,Make it true!
vc_wc,It is pretty stunning
vc_wc,Thanks bud!
vc_wc,Thank you sir!
vc_wc,"Thanks Nabs!

For the record, I did offer it to you before, but I think you are just too smitten with the sixties dial.

If you change your mind send me a PM and we can work something out"
vc_wc,tag
vc_wc,what are you looking for?
vc_wc,"Hi all, we dont see enough GO here on /r/watches, figured I would show you guys my [Senator Chronograph](https://imgur.com/8anEKr8.jpg). Its been a while since I posted my SOTC here and back then I was expecting this one to arrive in the mail. 

Well now that its here, I can tell you that it is hard to quantify the quality of workmanship and detail. Pictures dont do it justice, and its hard to describe, but when you have it in your hands in the metal, you notice all the details. Perhaps the most obvious is the [in-house movement you can see through the case back](https://imgur.com/4wgLHun.jpg) - its beautifully decorated, and the skeleton logo rotor is very nice. 

[The dial is simple and understated](https://imgur.com/0KKQCzn.jpg), and even though its a chrono, it can definitely pass for a dress watch; which I guess makes it somewhat unique as most chronos are more sporty or divers. The pushers and crown are buttery smooth, something that I cant describe but if you handle it yourself you can feel the difference against other chronos. 

I dont really have any cons for this watch, it has the right weight and size, it wears comfortably, and it plays well under the radar. Unfortunately it doesnt get much wear from me, though every time I pick it up I wonder to myself why not. The reality is that its a very nice watch, with great finishing and detail, at a great price for an in-house movement from a well respected brand. I think if I wore more formal attire in a daily basis, it would have a lot more wear in the rotation."

BRAND              |Glash√ºtte Original Senator Chronograph
--:|:--  
**Price**          |$4200 (OBRO)
**Watch Condition**|This is a gorgeous chronograph from Glash√ºtte Original. Its a 40mm steel case with a sapphire crystal. The dial is a silver/white color that has really warm tones, maybe its the lighting I use, but in the pictures it looks kind of tan/beige and in person it has a bit of that hue as well but not as pronounced. The dial has a seconds sub-dial, as well as a center seconds hand, a 30min, and 6-hour sub-dials for the chronograph. This watch has a gorgeous in-house movement that can be seen through the screw-down display case back. As you can see the movement, it is well decorated as you would expect from GO, it has a skeleton rotor with the GO logo, a gold flywheel and swan neck regulator. This is a 51 jewel movement. The watch comes with the original Louisiana Crocodile leather strap and GO buckle as pictured. This watch was bought in Hong Kong and getting the original strap into the USA was a total ordeal. 
**What's Included**|Watch, original crocodile strap, inner &amp; outer boxes, manual and warranty papers
**Payment method**|PAYPAL
**Location** |NY, USA  
**Shipping Method**|Insured and Signature required
**Anything Else?**|Looking to sell first, but definitely open to trades, up or down, down to multiples + cash also possible. I just have too many chronos that are more sporty and I dont have the opportunity to wear a dressy chrono like this.  
**Photos**|https://imgur.com/a/EpLDPCP - Please review as the pictures are part of the condition description. I have taken as many as I could from different angles.

**Timestamp/pics:**|https://imgur.com/a/Qp7o465#TlYQe72
**Description:**|For sale is my Rolex Sub 14060M, which most of us are familiar with. This has never been polished, as shown by the still very sharp lugs and very visible chamfers. The watch is overall in amazing condition with a perfect crystal, bezel, and dial. The bracelet has minimal desk diving marks (photos taken specifically to showcase these, but in person it's hard to tell there's a single scratch on it). Polished case sides show some micro scratching. Original case back sticker intact. Movement running strong with a good power reserve. The guy I bought it off of claims to have had it serviced four years ago. It winds beautifully and keeps good time, so I have no reason to doubt that. However, I make no claims about its service history or accuracy or water resistance rating since I wasn't the one who had it serviced. Typical ""Rolex click"" while winding, and the overwind clutch works as well.

Also, if you are going to raise an issue, you should at least do proper leg work before accusing someone. It took me 5 mins of searching to identify this watch as Ref. 81610

On the other hand you are accusing someone of posting a fake watch, so I'd be very sure of what you are saying before doing so.

Given that the item comes with the warranty card, which would match the serial of the watch, it would be unlikely (not impossible) for this to be a fake. Could it be a franken? maybe, but since it was raffled before and the current owner has not raised an issue, my guess is that it is the wrong ref#."

**Item Name:**|Rolex Submariner 16610 on original Oyster bracelet, E serial 
--:|:--
**Price:**|$5800 (100 @ $58)
**Call spots?**|Y
**Spot limit per person?**|0
**Location/Country:**|USA
**Will ship international?**|USA
**Timestamp/pics:**|https://imgur.com/a/XM5pXDG#Z64jk0h
**Description:**|Chamfers visible but possibly lightly polished at some point in its life since they do show some slight rounding but nothing crazy. Bezel insert and hands were replaced with Superluminova models at RSC four years ago but are in perfect shape, crystal is flawless, case is wonderful with barely any micro scratches, bracelet and clasp are in great shape too but clasp shows very slight wear on the Rolex logo. Between the chamfers and the Rolex logo on the clasp, I'm going to assume a very light touch up was done at some point. Sharp lugs. Movement winds well and keeps good time but is slightly noisy when winding. To be fair, this is my first 16610 so I'm not sure if this is normal, but it feels smooth. Dial is original and has a nice patina on the tritium. Watch head and bracelet only.

**Price Justification:**|[$2575](https://forums.watchuseek.com/f29/sale-tudor-prince-chronograph-tiger-79280-%242575-obo-4799845.html) - No B&amp;P w/ Bracelet - This is the best match as mine is also missing B&amp;P and I have the jubilee bracelet as well.

**Description:**|Putting up for raffle this Tudor Prince Date Tiger Panda in nice condition. I got this from Canada from a estate sale. I got carried away and got this one along with the SMP, while I love the look and feel of the watch I need to clear funds. This one came with just the bracelet and no B&amp;P. The dial and hands are in great condition, with the bezel showing some wear (look at the pictures). The case is fairly clean and it runs well, though I have only worn it sporadically as its part of a large rotation. When I wore it for a few days in a row I had no issues. The pushers have screws and they unscrew and screw smoothly, as well as the crown which has a great feel and no issues. I have no service history and have not tested it for water resistance.

**Item Name:**|Omega Seamaster Pro 300M Bond Ref. 2531.80
--:|:--
**Price:**|$2000 (100 @ $20)
**Price Justification:**|https://www.watchrecon.com/?query=2531.80&amp;sort_column=Price&amp;last_days=0&amp;availability[]=Sold - Lot of examples with a wide range in pricing. But if you look through and remove those with no bracelets and those not full kits (no B&amp;P) then the range is tighter, between $1800-$2500 - depending on condition. While mine is not mint, it is in great shape, I was told it was a safe queen and its easy to see. The watch was definitely worn, you can see the wear in the bracelet clasp, but the condition of the bezel, dial, red tip in the seconds hand, and the bright lume is just fantastic. I read every sold post and looked at condition, I encourage anyone to look at the condition of those sold, gashes or scratches or faded bezels, faded red tip on the second hand, discolored and dull lume plots.

**Description:**|Putting up for raffle this Omega Seamaster Pro Bond in fantastic condition. I got this from Canada from a estate sale and was told it was a queen safe from the original owner. I meant to keep this one but I need to free up some funds. I have had great luck in finding one of this in such great shape, look at the pristine dial with bright lume plots, the bright red tip on the seconds hand, and the unmarked bezel. The bracelet has seen some wear on the clasp, i assume just desk diving. I have the full bracelet with spare links and the links look to be in great shape with most of the wear just on the clasp. The lugs look good with minor strap changing marks, really it appears to be just regular wear from the bracelet rather than constant strap changes. I will include the rubber strap currently on it if the winner wants it.

**Description:**| For raffle is this gorgeous 3572.50 Omega Speedmaster Professional ""Hesalite Sandwich"" with an acrylic dial-facing crystal and a sapphire back. These have become very desirable over the years and are becoming quite the collector's item amongst Speedy fans. Additionally, it comes on a full-size (or near full size) 842/1499 bracelet, which is an excellent combo of vintage and modern, with a sexy taper from 20-16mm and modern solid link construction. The watch is ticking strong; all functions operate appropriately. Service history for this one is unknown, but the visible condition of the movement would suggest that this watch has not been neglected. Good luck!!!

**Description:**|I am the original owner and this was bought from the Breitling Boutique in St Thomas, USVI in March 2011. This is a seldom worn piece and its condition agrees. Some minor micro scratching around the high polished case but nothing unsightly. The watch and Pro II bracelet shine wonderfully and only in the absolute harshest of lights can you see any scratching. The Breitling-modified ETA movement keeps good time and has a good power reserve. Full kit, including warranty booklet and matching COSC certification paperwork, as well as all boxes (outer, inner, leather travel) and booklets. Crystal and AR coating are flawless, case/bezel/bracelet are all lacking any dings or dents but do have some superficial microscratching in various places of which, a CapeCod would polish right out. Desk diving marks are basically non-existent. I babied this watch and it shows as such. 41mm case with 20mm lugs. As you can see from the pricing examples (or searching ebay for Galactic 41), the price can vary. I cited two examples, one being a very nice full kit one for $2885 and another being a no box/paper on generic leather one for $1468. Given the condition of my watch is great and it has a full kit, I tried to pick somewhere in the middle of the two.

**Description:**|Tossing up the last of my watches due to a rather large vet bill we just incurred. Just out of warranty, purchased from an AD in May of 2016. The watch and bracelet are near-mint condition, apart from one small nick on a crown guard (shown in photos). Bezel, crystal, dial in mint condition. Keeping time wonderfully and winds beautifully, buttery smooth. Includes outer/inner boxes, warranty card with holder and booklet, instruction booklet, three spare links, rubber strap (used but in good condition) with diver extension, red hang tag. Note that the white specks you see in the first two photos are just dust.

**Description:**| Won this in a raffle but sadly it is too big for me. Catch and release. From original raffle: I picked this up a while back and have been wearing it off and on, but I just haven't worn it enough to justify keeping it. It's in excellent condition, with both the gold and the steel showing almost no wear, and the movement functions very well, with my rough timing a few seconds a day +-. Chrono works perfect as well. Box and papers, although the box has some damage to it as you can see in the pictures. It's 42mm across and wears very nicely. The strap is of unknown origin but the buckle is original Breitling.

vc_wc,"yeah seems like only a few of them are raffle-able on their own and many are just throw-aways/ins to increase the value of the raffle.

I imagine the amount of space taken would be significant. I am very tempted but i'll resist for now

"
vc_wc,"if it was not obvious before, i am just trolling :)

good luck with the raffle, has to be the biggest one here right? $38 spots are like 10x the usual spot around here. 

I am tempted but idk what i would do with so many bricks"
vc_wc,"cool. thank you! 

"
vc_wc,cool. I'll take a tag
vc_wc,"Sure. I read the rules and i assumed they applied to everyone. I am not a mod and its not my sub so i dont really care but got tired of refreshing and figured I would ask.

Also, I wanted to see how the raffle would go. Its a big ask for this sub. Are the spots going to be $38? $20? $10?

Somewhat local to me, have not seen any other info regarding probable cause. Very unfortunate. Unclear if he was taking those people to SC as some kind of charter. 

Anyone familiar with his fight school?

vc_wc,I do the same but thats the final step. im not adding some shady dude to my Linkedin
vc_wc,"OP, sorry this happened to you. It really sucks. I'm not going to beat you up because this sucks, but for others to learn from this:

Feedback, there is a whole sub for it. No feedback, tread extra carefully. Some feedback? Tread carefully. 
If you are trading, and you have feedback they should send first. Definitely wouldn't send cash until after trade is complete. 

Post history. I looked at this scammer post history and I wouldn't have traded with him. He sounds unhinged. 
Review their post history before engaging. Who and where they post and hang out can tell you about character and ethics and maybe state of mind. 
I don't care if it sounds judgy, it's your money and self preservation, you should take whatever steps you can to protect yourself.

Did you look him up? Exchange any personal info? Phone? Did you do any validation of their info? Maybe ask for a picture of a document that shows their address. Call or text to verify you have a valid phone number. 

OP, make sure you post in the feedback sub. Also add to the scammer list.

Call the police, it's definitely a crime. Provide all info you have. 

Good luck OP. "
vc_wc,Tell the redditor to fucking post a review and feedback. Could have saved you. And you should do the same. 
vc_wc,"im going to be in it. I miss it. 

When i decided to raffle it, it was still produced and readily available for purchase. I thought I would be able to pick one up at a later time prob at a decent price. 

Well that backfired. Its not longer available and not a ton of them online. Personally this is the speedy pro i would want to keep. It has the extra complication to differentiate from others, and it has the sapphire case back. "

**Description:**|For sale is one of the coolest watches I've had the pleasure of owning. It's the Omega Speedmaster Limited Edition Mark II made for the Rio Olympics. This watch is absolutely incredible. It's sharp edges, crisp inlay, incredible color profile all add up to a very special watch. The watch comes with everything: inner/outer boxes, papers, extra links, back sticker, Omega Cards and Limited Edition booklet. It's in beautiful condition with some tiny little nicks from normal wear visible in the photos. The watch is keeping near perfect time at +/- 1 second per day. The watch retailed for $6,500 and, as it's a limited run, it will continue keep it's value. Here is some more information from the Omega Website: https://www.omegawatches.com/en-us/watch-omega-specialities-olympic-games-collection-52210435001001  And here's a lovely write up from Hodinkee: https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-omega-speedmaster-mark-ii-rio-2016

**Description:**|For sale is Tudor Heritage Black Bay Red, the watch that needs no introduction. Condition is pretty great for 5 years old. Bracelet has light swirls, which aren‚Äôt too noticeable unless you really look hard under the right lighting. Bezel is excellent with no flaws. The case has a few light scratches, which I tried to show in the pictures. A noticeable ding on the front right lug, and a few others on the other lugs, which I pictured well. The caseback has a few scuffs, but nothing out of the ordinary. Scrapes on the back of lugs from changing straps, which are pictured. Mechanically the watch functions perfectly and keeps great time. Watch was purchased at Howard Fine Jewelers (Tudor AD) Jan of 2013. Watch comes with inner and outer box, manual, warranty card, warranty booklet, and all bracelet links. The bracelet is currently fit for my 7.25 inch wrist.

vc_wc,"You got 35, 79, 96"
vc_wc,You got 24
vc_wc,"Lol fine. I don't really care. But you are not selling your stuff here that's for sure. We know that the demographic buying the stuff you are posting is not typically here. 

You might sell a piece here, maybe, probably to someone that found it via watchrecon. But this is not really the channel for the type of stuff you post. I know that and you know that. 

So the question is then, other than flexing and showing off (which is fine, although not the right sub for it), why you post them here if your buyers are not here. 

You got some cool pieces that's for sure and you are free to post them here. But some of your ads are disingenuous, I won't search for it but in one of them you say ""idk if serviced but it's running perfectly"" or something along those lines. And the next sentence reveals you had it for less than 12 hours. How can you determine or assure a buyer how well it's running if you barely had it in your hands for that long? "
vc_wc,Very nice story. Congratulations on an awesome watch. Great piece to keep and pass down
vc_wc,"Yeah I have estimated it will take between $12-$15k to get my PPL. That's mostly all air time and doing my own studying.

It's crazy when you think you only need a few hours. I have considered taking a couple of weeks and trying to do it that way in a single seating. "

vc_wc,"The point of an open marketplace is to allow the market to dictate prices. I dont like inflated prices either but people should be free to post whatever price they want and let the market decide. Thats true whether you are a private seller or a dealer.

If i recall, at least part of the reason dealers were ran out in the past was because they were taking valuable front page space with their volume of WTS posts that nobody wanted to see. 

"
vc_wc,waitlist for 1 spot
vc_wc,I'll take #5 only no random replacement
vc_wc,"See, I don't know about your first point. You can see the same watches or nicer and rarer ones on /r/watches as well. This is not really the place to just show off. Of course he is selling them, or at least listing them... But unlikely he is selling them here.

There was a time when every dealer was ran out of the sub pretty quickly so it's a surprising turn that people are not pulling their pitchforks like they did against some other dealers that used to post here. 

I assume the novelty will wear off unless he starts actually selling stuff here and getting feedback.

To your actual point, these are just targeted to a specific audience. The price has nothing to do with it, there are gorgeous, refined, and much more low key watches that are also very expensive. And you also have just as gaudy and flashy Invicta for a lot less. My point is, don't blame the price point, blame the taste.
That's not too say I dislike everything he has posted, but I prob wouldn't be a buyer in most of that stuff either cause it's out of my price range but mostly it's just not my type."
vc_wc,"Congratulations /u/flyingnome82!!!

Please PM your info to /u/daytosmile!"

this is a very hard to get watch, MSRP is only around 11-12k. But you may be on a waitlist for years so there is a premium in the secondary market. "

**Description:**|Bought this from the original owner a few months back. It wouldn't manually wind, but would wind via the auto rotor. I sent it to The Watch Doctor in PA for a full overhaul. He did the overhaul, replaced the auto drive wheel (to fix crown winding), and put in a new crystal. This includes a 1-year warranty through TWD. He has been around for decades and I know numerous folks that have used him. So far, so good and this beauty winds and keeps time like new. Some clear blemishes around the case from 18 years of general use by the original owner. Full box and paper kit with matching serial number (serial intentionally left exposed in photos, for your verification). The original owner claimed it had never been polished and I believe him, to a certain extent. You can still make out some chamfers and I guess it's reasonable that they could have just naturally worn, but I am not making any claims about polishing either way. The lugs are super sharp and appear to be all the same thickness. If it was polished, it was probably just a light touch up and is nowhere near overpolished. Bracelet does have some sag but still feels decently solid, with SEL.

vc_wc,"Hey man thanks for responding and being transparent. I don't envy your position as I think it's a tough item to price.

I don't know much about the specific movements so I wouldn't know where to start. If you have proof of service that might help as you would hope the service is warrantied at least a few months after.

Good luck with the raffle!"
vc_wc,"Hey /u/meech96 can you explain a little more about the watch? 

What happened to the original 2500 co-axial movement? Why would someone replace a newer better movement with an older movement? I'm going to guess worse but I really don't know them very well. 

This would qualify as a franken watch and hard to price imo. Your comps are for fully original watches with original movements. This is not that. I don't know if it's worth less or more but it's definitely different. 

Finally you say it was serviced months ago but it may need a new service?  It doesn't add up. "
vc_wc,"fucking reddit... they gotta fix their shit. either force the new shitty version or show everything in both versions

**Description:**|I am the original owner and this was bought from the Breitling Boutique in St Thomas, USVI in March 2011. This is a seldom worn piece and its condition agrees. Some minor micro scratching around the high polished case but nothing unsightly. The watch and Pro II bracelet shine wonderfully and only in the absolute harshest of lights can you see any scratching. The Breitling-modified ETA movement keeps good time and has a good power reserve. Full kit, including warranty booklet and matching COSC certification paperwork, as well as all boxes (outer, inner, leather travel) and booklets. Crystal and AR coating are flawless, case/bezel/bracelet are all lacking any dings or dents but do have some superficial microscratching in various places of which, a CapeCod would polish right out. Desk diving marks are basically non-existent. I babied this watch and it shows as such. 41mm case with 20mm lugs. As you can see from the pricing examples (or searching ebay for Galactic 41), the price can vary. I cited two examples, one being a very nice full kit one for $2885 and another being a no box/paper on generic leather one for $1468. Given the condition of my watch is great and it has a full kit, I tried to pick somewhere in the middle of the two.

**Description:**|This Carrera CV2119 was made to mark the 80th Birthday of Jack Heuer former CEO, and grandson of the founder of TAG Heuer. It has a silver sunburst dial and vintage styling inspired by the original ‚Äò64 Carrera. #1,389 out of 3,000 made. There are beautiful red highlights on the dial with the classic Heuer shield logo, tips of the chronograph hands and a highlighted 80 on the dark-grey inner- tachy bezel. The watch is 41mm and has a calibre 17 movement. The caseback contains the Heuer family crest and Jack Heuers signature. The watch came on the black calf strap with red soft rubber lining. I prefer to wear it on the leather band but I also have the matching stainless steel bracelet. The watch keeps great time and is gently worn and in excellent condition. Cosmetically there are minor scuffs on the bracelet and small scratches on the underside of the lugs from band replacement. It is hidden when the watch is worn. There is one very small scratch on the bezel near the 1 o‚Äôclock postion. Please see the pictures. Here is an excellent article about the watch: https://www.calibre11.com/tag-heuer-carrera-jack-heuer-80th-birthday/

**Description:**|43.5mm with ceramic bezel and lacquered orange numerals. The movement contains 38 jewels and twin barrel springs to attain 60 hour power reserve. The watch is in great condition with some minor scuffs and scratches picked up over the years. I just purchased an extra link from Omega so that it fits up to a 7.25‚Äù - 7.5‚Äù wrist. The presentation box is very cool and comes with some literature on the Good Planet foundation

**Escrow:**|Y u/vc_wc for /u/evilr2
**Description:**|Received this one in a trade from /u/vc_wc which I believe he acquired from an estate sale.  Unfortunately there are no box or papers for this one.  There serial shows 60,000 series and I can‚Äôt figure out an exact date since different websites show different dates for production runs, but this thing is in incredible condition.  The crystal is clean and bezel looks clean.  There are a couple of slight dings at the edges of the bezel, which I think I captured pretty well on the pics in side view, more visible on the helium release valve side.  Bracelet shows minimal wear, but a few desk diving marks.  The fit is pretty snug on my 7.75‚Äù wrist and probably would wear perfectly on 7.5‚Äù, as there are no extra links.  This thing is a classic and even at it‚Äôs assumed age of around 20 years, still wears well and looks good.  Here are the specs from [Omega‚Äôs site]( https://www.omegawatches.com/en-us/watch-omega-seamaster-300-m-chrono-diver-25998000).

The watch is in excellent condition, with no scratches on the actual watch head or lugs. There are small hairline scratches on the clasp and parts of the bracelet. Next to the screws are some scratches since my screwdiver partially slipped. The screws are all able to come out and be put in. All original removed links (the bracelet is sized for a 6.5 inch wrist) are included. The warranty is dated July 2018, and the watch will come with the box, warranty booklet with card, and inspection certificate. The watch keeps great time, with less than a second per day of inaccuracy.

**Description:**| For sale is an increasingly rare and beautiful Speedmaster Professional 3572.50. This is the model with a hesalite crystal and sapphire case back. The watch comes with a 849/1998 bracelet (the last version with push pins). It is large enough to accommodate a 7.25"" wrist without issue. The watch was serviced in 2012 by Omega and it is still keeping good time. All chronograph functions work as expected and no issues exist to my knowledge. Good luck with the raffle and, to the winner, enjoy this beautiful watch!

**Description:**| I picked this up a while back and have been wearing it off and on, but I just haven't worn it enough to justify keeping it. It's in excellent condition, with both the gold and the steel showing almost no wear, and the movement functions very well, with my rough timing a few seconds a day +-. Chrono works perfect as well. Box and papers, although the box has some damage to it as you can see in the pictures. It's 42mm across and wears very nicely. The strap is of unknown origin but the buckle is original Breitling.

**Item Name:**|Omega Seamaster 300 No-Date ""WatchCo"" - NOS Build - 1960s
--:|:--
**Price:**|$3700 (100 @ $37)
**Call spots?**|Y
**Spot limit per person?**|N
**Location(Country):**|USA
**Will ship international?**|Yes - Winner to cover extra cost and any duties and/or fees. 
**Timestamp/pics:**| https://imgur.com/a/4ogPuq0
**Description:**|This is a newly-constructed, no-date ""WatchCo""* Seamaster 300. All parts used in this build (with the exception of the 552 movement) were freshly removed from the service packaging a few months ago. The watch has been worn fewer than five times. Note that this has the highly-desirable ""no-date"" dial, which are becoming exceptionally hard to find in this condition. The person I purchased this from had the 552 movement serviced prior to assembly, so the watch is keeping good time and should be good to go for 4-5 years, which is a nice bonus. Please not that this is a vintage diver, so please be aware of this before pressure testing and exposing to deep waters. *For those who may not know, WatchCo was a previous Omega parts account-holder and sold off many service dials, cases, and other parts of notable Omega timepieces. People would put a 1960s Omega movement in of the proper calibre, and then a fully-functioning, NOS Omega was born.

**Description:**|The watch is a ‚ÄúRolex 1002 Solid Gold OP with Silver Sunburst Underline Dial‚Äù from 1963. Watch is in good shape and is keeping good time. The plexi has small scratches as is shown in the pics and is expected. Can be removed fairly easily. It‚Äôs a beautiful watch and gets many compliments. Comes with a crocodile brown strap never used, an alligator installed on it now, a blue suede strap, and a Spiedel 10k filled stretch bracelet that works amazing with this watch for the full gold effect. The Spiedel stretch is very accurate also for this time period and likely would be purchased at the same time.

You go as big as you want on the Daytona with the money i paid for the Ultraman. If you win, I keep the Ultraman. If you lose, you can buy the Ultraman from me for what I paid you. 

If you win and you still miss the ultraman, I'll straight swap it to you for the Daytona.

Deal?"

**Description:**|Won this from /u/username2571. Raffling it in the same condition as I received it. **Original Description:** Full set, inner and outer boxes, hangtag, apparently unworn rubber strap, manual and warranty card dated 3/28/2018! This is the more preferred 2-line version of the Pelagos, so you get the great Pelly look without the 5 lines of text cluttering up the dial. I have not worn the watch since winning it, and it appears that the prior owner did not wear it much at all as there are only a couple of swirls and none on the clasp. This watch is a rare find to have a 2 line Pelagos in this great condition with a warranty card dated only a few months old.

**Description From Original Raffle:**|Tag Heuer Carrera Chronograph. Black on black with nice factory original strap with many years left on it. Watch has a couple small scratches from normal wear. Just repolished the case and clasp myself and ultrasonic‚Äôd the strap so it would look newer and shinier for new owner. Unfortunately does not have original box and papers. Everything works great and chronos reset as they should. This Tag Heuer has been freshly serviced. I‚Äôll include receipt in album.

vc_wc,"if you can prove it works, as im sure you can. Then it might be enticing for some folks to throw a $5-10 spot at it as a backup. I am not into photography so i may be talking out of my ass (again). "

vc_wc,"I tend to agree with you on this one. Its so easy to use watchrecon and filter sold: https://www.watchrecon.com/?query=70330&amp;last_days=0&amp;availability%5B%5D=Sold

vc_wc,/u/BoyAndHisBot 2 55
vc_wc,"**From /u/WatchRaffleMod:** I am incredibly grateful for the donation of the spots and of course for this win. Getting spots was completely unexpected and unnecessary, yet I recognize how well meaning it was from /u/EliRulez to do so and I truly appreciate the gesture. Of course, I couldnt be happier about the win - and after a rough week with several dumpster fires it definitely made me feel appreciated and just reinforced how much I love this community. However, dumpster fires, poops, and being around to dish them out is what we signed up for, and we did it knowingly. So please dont feel obligated to do anything for us. Shit happens, but just follow the rules and use common sense and we'll all be alright.  In order to keep anonimity of the mods, I cannot keep this watch so it has to be released back into the wild. As a token of appreciation I have asked /u/vc_wc to run a couple of raffles to give some spots away ahead of this raffle

**Per /u/WatchRaffleMod instructions, we will be doing the following:**

   * 1. (Most Of) The participants from the original raffle will be entered into a side raffle and 5 winners will be picked. Each one will get 1 spot in this raffle.
   * 2. There will be a 100 spot freebie raffle. 5 Winners will be picked, each one will get 1 spot in the raffle. This raffle will have a 1 spot limit and you cannot request a spot for yourself. You must nominate someone. People may be nominated several times by different people but there is only 1 request per person. Lets try to nominate some deserving folks

***

* **Blue NM - Will run when a spot opens up this week**
* **Get your tags below for this raffle and the freebie before it**

vc_wc,tag me
vc_wc,Holy shit you are alive!
vc_wc,Is that Tudor originally from /u/xioth?
vc_wc,I have been chasing that helson for a while now... I'll take another shot at it I guess
vc_wc,"I understand. Reference number should be a requirement tbh because that's the only way to know we are comparing apples to apples when considering a purchase. 

Tag me if you do get it authenticated. Even if I don't buy it I'd like to learn more about it"
vc_wc,"OP it would be good to have more information on the reference #. 

I'd like to see some more pictures of the dial from a straight forward angle. There are a couple of things that look a little odd/off and may just be the angle of the picture

As others have pointed out, some of the details dont match up but we are all guessing what reference # it may be. So maybe you have a transitional model or a model we dont recognize and had different variations

As it is, your price is way below the 2 most likely references and it has some inconsistencies with those so something doesnt add up.

However, I thought the item was priced generously since its about 20% below what I would consider market since the comps either dont have bracelet, or dont have Omega warranty.

**Description:**|Here is my Omega Railmaster, purchased last December at the Omega boutique in NYC. I love this thing. It can take a beating (as pictured) and is the perfect watch to take on adventures. It has gone rock climbing, diving, hiking up Mt. Harvard in Colorado, and obviously the most intense of all: desk diving. I was going to sell this eventually to make up for the 3 other Omegas I want this year, but that is now taking a back seat to the Daytona raffle next month. I'm selling everything that has not been forbidden by my better half.

vc_wc,please dont even mention that fucking place around here.
vc_wc,screw it i'll take 89 and 78
vc_wc,"I'll take all of the following: #11, #22, #23, #32 only if they are available. No random replacement.

If all of the above are gone, i'll take just 1 random. 

Thanks!"
vc_wc,I also suggest you post it to /r/rolex. the mod there is pretty good.
vc_wc,"So, my first reaction when i saw the pic posted was that it looked a little odd, right in the same area as you. That text didnt look right and went looking for examples. 

I think the pic quality doesnt help, but i found [one of the same serial](http://s3.amazonaws.com/hq-milton-watch-photos-production/timepieces/photos/b35eef7881f3a63235dc89b819535c9c63ccdac0.jpg) and it has the same alignment. it still doesnt look great to me as i'd like to see more pictures.
"
vc_wc,no shit. do you still have it?
vc_wc,"good fucking memory, yeah it was. alexandergarciaaa was his name"
vc_wc,"Sometimes I feel meh about the BLNR, this is not one of those times. Nice watch!"
vc_wc,nice! 
vc_wc,very nice! Happy Birthday!
vc_wc,Oh yiss wearing the [crown on the wrong side](https://i.imgur.com/YNyylMr.jpg) and idgaf
vc_wc,Last week was hectic. I'll put it in the mail tomorrow!
vc_wc,"I would say A.

I can see how someone may pocket the money and never service it and then try to raffle it again here at a higher price. It also inflates the price of the raffle unnecessarily IMO, plus it delays it for a while.

If it must be one of the other 2, then I vote for B. Although I understand why you would not want to front the price of the service and then have to raffle it. "
vc_wc,Again. No lume shots...
vc_wc,Someone should get another üí©
vc_wc,"no b&amp;p? bad scratch/condition? assume out of warranty as well?

I wouldnt touch it for a penny more than $9k and thats already somewhat generous. Why? Because you can get one full set, in good/great condition, from a reputable dealer, prob with warranty for just under/around $10k. "
vc_wc,Wish I had seen this at this price
vc_wc,We could be twinsies!
vc_wc,Dude you are doxxing yourself. This is not a PM. Delete!
vc_wc,"I don't know about pricing and it is a good looking watch but I would suggest lowering the spot price to either $5 or $10. 

Give more people a chance to enter and those that really want better odds can buy more spots. "
vc_wc,"That's just the op posting his email address instead of a PayPal.me link. The problem for some people is that certain iphone Reddit apps don't open those properly either. 

I prefer the PayPal.me link as well. "
vc_wc,I already paid you shark
vc_wc,I'll take 1 random please. I'm out of service so if I don't pay someone please cover me

vc_wc,"there is a link to the rules on the sidebar: https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchURaffle/wiki/rules

Also, none of them raffled for anything above $2200, and nothing that had scuffs and scratches on the crystal - so after further wear I dont know how it should go for higher than raffled before.

"

vc_wc,Was the watch sized and has spare links? Does it still have the stickers?

Good luck everyone, lets get this filled so we get some more Blue NMs going!"
vc_wc,You got 82
vc_wc,"what happens if something is posted at 11am, fills by 2pm. per your rule you cant start a new Blue NM again?

There are prob better options like maybe adding more ""gates"" to the Blue NM so it moves at a good pace.

Another option could be to reduce the amount they can stay alive. Double edge sword though, if stuff consistently cancels it becomes unattractive to sellers."
vc_wc,"not with that attitude! The nomos stalled hard, I'll see how I can get us through the finish line. Starting late at night is tough, but waiting until the morning means fighting for the Blue NM spot."
vc_wc,"Yes. I'd be interested in the Dornbluth. I have a GO (not a sixties though, or i would have already told you) that is a [dressy chrono](https://i.imgur.com/mWlg5im.png)."

**Description:**|These were only produced for a short time from 2006 - 2011 and use a caliber 3612 movement which is based on a F.Piguet movement. Basically, it is the Omega variant of the F. Piguet caliber 1286 featuring a Co-Axial escapement and a column wheel chronograph mechanism. It is a touch larger than a normal speedmaster at 44.25mm but the difference is barely noticeable on the wrist. it has a sapphire case back, which allows a nice view of the ridiculously beautiful movement. The Split second chronograph is a ton of fun to play with, it has the typical Tachymeter increments on the crown as well as a base 30 increments on the face - typically used for recording your pulse (start the chronometer, count 30 heart beats and stop it, the arrow will be pointing at your heart rate). The watch is in great condition, was serviced last year by the previous owner, although the paperwork has gone missing. it has the usual fine line scratches from minimal use, the only issue worth reporting about the case is a slight ding by the split second chrono pusher - not very noticeable unless you run a fingernail across the case. The Bad: does not come with box/paperwork or the original strap, but does come with a red Omega Service case, and canvas NATO strap. I'll also include an Aaron Bespoke custom made beaver leather strap that i've never used but looks pretty great with the watch

vc_wc,it really depends on the watch. There are some gorgeous rose gold watches. In general im not huge on gold but i have seen some really nice watches that I would definitely wear.
vc_wc,Not drinking enough obviously
vc_wc,this is the one time it counts!

vc_wc,please give #11 to /u/spartan_029 maybe it will win for him - replace with random ok. im paying for it
vc_wc,"I know nothing about this watch. Maybe some more info? Looks nice.

It's probably worth a try as an NM and you can run it yourself.

I would consider cheaper spot prices. I'm not throwing a $10 at it. But maybe a $5. Definitely a $3. "
vc_wc,Dude. Yes. Tag me. How much?
vc_wc,correct
vc_wc,for a long while if an Omega was not a speedy it had a hard time filling. I mean seamasters and some POs did ok but ATs and others did not.
vc_wc,"Looking to try again and run this Nomos Tangente **Datum Gangreserve** 
 (yes, it has a date AND it has a power reserve indicator)

**Description:**| Part of my chase for the right Nomos. I needed to see the power reserve feature in person. I get it now, its fun and its a unique execution on this complication. Overall its a really nice watch but its a little smaller than I would like. It also lacks the splash of color that the Metro has. This one I picked up from someone that won it in a raffle a while back. **It comes with an extra brand new Nomos suede strap ($60), and also with a brand new deployant clasp ($100).**

vc_wc,"Blob, my personal preference here if your winder has it, its to go with the 5 min rotation each way. It goes for 3 hours in that mode and then goes to sleep for 9 hours. It will work well on your new Milgauss."
vc_wc,"It was not my money. It was the incredible generosity from some of the folks that won the 50/50 raffle and just decided to give their winnings away to Blob. 

Sorry if they didnt want visibility but they deserve it /u/Zangadia and /u/WhiskeyMan4"
vc_wc,"I didnt do anything man, i contributes just like the rest of us. Definitely a full sub accomplishment. Very cool we were able to do this!"
vc_wc,Both of you!
vc_wc,Classy move. good luck!
vc_wc,Fuck yeah! Good luck Blob!!!!
vc_wc,thats no excuse. get your raffle on
vc_wc,Nice. Welcome back and good luck!
vc_wc,"if this guy is in canada or some other state that is hard and expensive to get to, i'll take it :)"
vc_wc,"hi its me, Bill. This is my week. How much am I getting?"
vc_wc,"Not OP but I don't get this. 

Send me the info and now you are the salesperson I'll deal with. The lease terms are not negotiable unless you are marking up the mf. 

This gives you a leg up on the other dealers. 

Oh well I figured it's worth the 5 mins it takes to reply and be first in line for when OP is ready to buy.

My only complaint with OP email is that it didn't include the model and trim with packages wanted. Then salesperson could give better and more information, whether that's for a car in the lot if they have it or enough info to order one. Easy deal. "
vc_wc,Where the fuck have you been?!
vc_wc,Good to see you around dude
vc_wc,Looks like everyone is using their winnings here. Send me a total when you are done Nabs
vc_wc,What he said is correct. I just woke up from my nap.

Alright. we have kicked the non-payers (shameful) and I have made a call to buy a few more to round it up to 2448 spots - this would mean /u/BoyAndHisBlob gets the equivalent to 35 spots in the milgauss. 

Once this request is filled. We will randomize the spots and call the escrow bot for 24 winners. Good luck everyone!"

I am beyond impressed and grateful for the generosity shown here. I knew this place was awesome and the sense of community is great, but the display of support here for /u/BoyAndHisBlob has blown me away. 

I had planned on running this through most of the day today but for reasons out of my control, I am going to close this out by around noon today - we have combined to call almost **2400 spots**, i have never seen anything like it!

Thank you again to everyone that bough a spot, 1 or 300, as every bit helps. Stay tuned for around noon when we will call out the winners of the raffle and present the total to the Tool Master /u/BoyAndHisBlob"

**Description:**|Your chance to own a modern Vacheron automatic without (completely) draining your life savings! The watch was fully overhauled at Vacheron in December of 2016. It was put in the safe then and has not been worn. Not even once. The watch is in pristine like new condition. It measures 37mm and about 9mm in height. It wears slightly bigger in my opinion. The sale includes all manuals, certificates, service paperwork - everything that would have been included if as purchased new (minus tags). This is a super classy piece and gets an appropriate amount of attention. It is a great conversation starter and is an extremely detailed beauty! Happy to help answer any questions. Thanks!

**Item Name:**|Fundraiser - 1 Winner for Every 100 Spots
--:|:--
**Price:**|$2
**Call spots?**|N
**Spot limit per person?**|N
**Location(Country):**|USA
**Will ship international?**|N
**Timestamp/pics:**|https://i.imgur.com/6DglqKH.jpg
**Description:**|If you are an old sub member, you may recall that we did fundraisers for a few folks. Since the sub died, there was one key contributor that never got the recognition I think he deserved. /u/BoyAndHisBlob has been instrumental in the growth and success of the sub, not just this sub but others like legos and knife subs also owe blob and great deal of thanks. I remember what it was like to run a raffle without his tool and cannot imagine running the kind of raffles we do here, with such high values and with such speed, without the tool he built and continues to support and enhance without any compensation. 
**.**|As you may have read, there is a Milgauss coming up and this is Blob's grail. You may have noticed he has been clearing some of his collection, most likely to go big on the milgauss. We figured this was an opportunity to do something cool for Blob and run a 50/50 raffle to try to raise some more funds for his grail, and also give one of us a chance to get some funds for our own grail. I have setup the buy-in to be super low in the hopes that even if you dont have a ton of $, that you consider pitching in for even just 1 spotl think about how many raffles are made possible and run smoothly because of the work he has done.
**Special Instructions**|I will assign numbers in the order requested and will continue to add spots as we continue to fill. I will plan on closing this raffle on Tuesday afternoon. Once its closed, I will randomize the numbers (using blob's tool) and then select 1 winner for every 100 spots assigned by using the escrow spots bot. In the end, 50% of the raffle proceeds will go to Blob and the other 50% will be divided by all the winners called.

**Price:**|$6700 (100 @ $67)
**Call spots?**|Y
**Spot limit per person?**|N
**Location(Country):**|Oh Canada
**Will ship international?**|Yes - Winner responsible for excess cost as well as any duties and fees
**Timestamp/pics:**|https://imgur.com/a/k4Fn2T7
**Description:**|Condition is 9/10 I guess. Extremely light swirling on the bracelet, a couple of tiny fleabites on the case, but I couldn't get the angle right to show them in pics. There's also a faint mark on the caseback where my wedding ring grazed it. It looks like it's been worn for maybe a couple of weeks. There's not much I can say for the description, it's a polar 42mm 216570, comes with full kit, warranty card dated Sept 20, 2017. It's a freaking sweet watch that doesn't really need a description ;) haha

vc_wc,It is always ET
vc_wc,I think its getting smaller as they have been working over the years to price the residual closer to market. But I know it still happens on some models.
vc_wc,lol what? i paid
vc_wc,what are you trying to say?
vc_wc,I'll take a waitlist for up to 5 spots
vc_wc,"&gt; If they drop off the car as a simple lease return the dealer might be able to buy it out from the manufacturer for slightly less. But certainly not a large sum less than what they originally set the cars prices at. 

This is where we disagree. 

Maybe thats how it is for Honda, but I am telling you that a) BMW Financial set the residual artificially high  (71% on a 328 wagon for example or 76% on a Z3) knowing it will be worth less, and b) they offered it to the dealer for a LOT less than residual. 

Now, they may not do this as much but BMW has (pretty sure still in place) a policy that the lessee returning cannot buy the car (for less than residual) after its returned, specifically to prevent this as it was such a good deal. If they had to make a policy around it, its because it was a thing."
vc_wc,"I dont think it ever had a bracelet, it came with a Bundt leather strap, which IMO, looked like shit and was a PITA."
vc_wc,Nice! It is much nicer in person. 
vc_wc,"I think im either not explaining myself clearly or you may want to look into reading comprehension.

**EXAMPLE**

* Car is worth $20k as you can buy them for that much from every dealer
* Residual is $25k - because they inflated residuals at inception
* Customer returns car
* Dealer can buy car from manufacturer or pass and manufacturer sells the car (to other dealer or ends up at auction)
* if dealer buys the car, customer can work with dealer to buy it. This is outside of the lease transaction, which was already over when they returned the car and paid their disposition fee

The price the manufacturer offers it to the dealer is not the $25k residual and it not just $1k or lower because of taxes as you have said several times. It is prob offered to dealer at around the $20k market value (likely a little less); or if they are not, all these cars end up at auction going for less than market.

Nowhere have i said anything about buying your lease from a dealer, or tricking a dealer into selling a car for less than they paid. I am also happy to accept my ignorance, if you were actually sharing some knowledge, but you dont seem to be comprehending the concept. As I said before, this is not a made up pie in the sky bullshit scenario; I have been part of 2 of these myself and know of countless others. Now, this was a few years ago and i know at least BMW tightened up both their residuals but also closed this ""loophole"" for prior owners; but it still happens"

vc_wc,"I appreciate the reply.

I dont know that we are talking about the same. 

I have personally had 2 experiences (and know of many more) where i returned my lease which had a residual of x. My friend wanted to buy it, so we talked to the dealer and the dealer cost was much lower than residual and there was enough room for both the dealer and the buyer to be happy. The dealer even put the extra $ (and got paid for that) by doing the CPO on it. 

In the end, my friend's cost was way (a few thousand) below the residual. The best example was a manual 328i xDrive Touring that i had leased with a 71% residual. That thing was worth maybe 55% of MSRP.

My point was, and i dont know this for sure, but i would be shocked if BMW was offering these vehicles for residual or even just $1k below to the dealers. They would never be able to move it and they would all end up at auction with a glut of BMWs at auction and at indy dealer lots. "
vc_wc,"I think the point got lost in the examples. All i was saying is that OP was/is able to talk to the dealer, return the lease like any other return but work with the dealer to possibly buy it back (outside of his lease process). The dealer could offer him a better deal than him buying off his residual, and both dealer and customer win. "
vc_wc,"I think you can struggle to get some sought out watches if there are only 2 spots for &gt; $3k. We will only get those that are sitting around unsold, anyone else will want to move sooner than wait 4-5 weeks for a spot to raffle their watch.

If you are saying &gt; $5k then maybe thats more doable. "
vc_wc,"I never claimed you were making 30% on all these returns, that was an example to illustrate the point.

But there is a difference, and can be considerable, between residual and what the dealer gets for cost. 

I'm not saying that's wrong or that the dealer doesn't deserve the profit, in the contrary, I'm saying if OP wants to buy his car and residual is way above market, go talk to the dealer and you both can win. 

Educate me, what's the profit on a lease return then? What about one that you can revision for CPO very cheaply? And what about after you as all the CPO Dale's support from the brand? 

If profit on lease returns was not sensible, then stores wouldn't pick them up and let them go to auction. 
I don't know how Honda works, maybe they are not as profitable. But I had BMW dealers fight for my lease return even though I never buy from them and they know that."
vc_wc,"I never understood the hostility on this sub.

Correct me if I'm wrong and it's been a few years but as far as I know, BMW will offer it to the receiving dealer at, what you call, adjusted residual. If dealer declined, it gets offered at BMW only auction at or around the same price. If nobody picks it up, then it goes to auction. 

Depending on the car, there could be a little difference or a big difference. You say it's nothing crazy, but I have seen and been part of deals that has several thousands in difference. When you are setting residuals for a z3 at 76%, there are going to be big discrepancies in 3 years.

While you said there isn't much difference, I think maybe they are getting better, but the manufacturer cannot/won't sell a car to a dealer at residual or even adjusted by $1k. The store wouldn't make any money so they would just let it go to auction. The manufacturer doesn't want all it's lease returns to go to auction.
The manufacturer has to offer the car to the dealer at close enough to market or they won't be able to sell it.
"
vc_wc,"i don't get the downvoteds but whatever.

It got to the point that at BMW they won't let you buy your car back from the dealer for less than residual. You could get some great deals returning your lease and buying the car back from the dealer for a lot less and both customer and dealer did well. I believe I this is still policy now. "
vc_wc,"I was using whole numbers to illustrate. For example, BMW had been, in the past, notorious for inflating residuals just to make leases more attractive. I have personally returned leases that had residuals with 10k over actual value.

The dealer doesn't pay the residual price, it's a wholesale price. The dealer can choose to not pick it up. If they do, you can certainly buy it for less than residual and more than wholesale. 

What brand is your store? "
vc_wc,"If I can nominate someone, I'll nominate /u/rivven1 /u/boyandhisblob and /u/rawrsomesausage"
vc_wc,And thank you for running this freebie!
vc_wc,Thanks dude!
vc_wc,"Car is worth 20k per market value. Your residual is 30k. You wouldntv pay residual for it right?

Now, dealer can buy the car from the manufacturer for 16k. They will put it on the lot for $20k.

You could go and buy your car back from them for the asking 20k or you could negotiate a little and buy it for less.

An option here, is to tell the dealer that's what you'd like to do. The dealer might sell it to you for $18k. They make a quick profit without hassle, you get a car you know at a fair price without hassle. Win win. "
vc_wc,"Actually yes. But as 2 transactions. Return it. Then ask the dealer if they will sell it to you. The dealer gets it at a price different/lower than residual, you can then negotiate like any other purchase, with the benefit that you know the history.

Now, you could talk to the dealership that you would like to do this and that may help then tell you if it will make sense.

It's definitely doable, but some brands have rules and regulations around this as they want to avoid this work around.

Edit: to clarify, the accident has no bearing on this though. They will likely not give you any diminished value pricing but they will price it according to market"
vc_wc,"VR I think maybe you are comparing it to the peak of edc_r. Because in the last couple of months of edc_r, with the mod vacation, and then during the transition with 2 subs, the sub was basically on life support. 

If anything I think it looks pretty healthy in terms of organic growth. It feels every time i look, the number of subs is going up. Its never going to jump to the 3-4k without having to deal with the same shit we did when rugby guy posted in watches. The old sub had 1 day where they gained 600 subs in one single day. Thats nuts.

The queue has been really great, and it has an effect on other raffles when the # of subs is so low. As people have said, there is only so much raffle budget to go around. 

As for the meta, remember that the old sub died and people scrambled to find this place. Its not back to what it was, but in the last weeks of edc_r the meta had been dead as well. The discord definitely plays a role as a lot of convos happen there instead of meta. 

IMO some raffles going unfilled its not a terrible thing. We dont want it to be the norm, but its ok for some to fail. It highlights that we need more subscribers. I think OPs should do a better job of marketing their raffle, you dont have to spam a sub to do it but there are ways to do it in a thoughtful and discreet way.

**Description:**| Part of my chase for the right Nomos. I needed to see the power reserve feature in person. I get it now, its fun and its a unique execution on this complication. Overall its a really nice watch but its a little smaller than I would like. It also lacks the splash of color that the Metro has. This one I picked up from someone that won it in a raffle a while back. **It comes with an extra brand new Nomos suede strap ($60), and also with a brand new deployant clasp ($100).**

**Description:**| I have been chasing a Nomos Metro and in the meantime have basically tried every other Nomos model. I really like this one, but if I would keep it, I would go with the Campus model and the California dial. I have worn it maybe a handful of times, its in the shape I received it. There are some minor scratches and swirls, I have not noticed anything major. I won this from Salami boy /u/RoninDog on an escrow, first and only time i ever won on an escrow. It was previously raffled for $1400. **I will also pay out the 2 spots above and 2 spots below the called winner.**

**Description:**| I picked this up via watchex around December. I had been looking for one of these for a little while and its a great watch. Its definitely a simpler field watch, but it helped me hold off getting an exp 1. It has great lume, and a big dial with no bezel so it wears a little bigger. It has a screw-in crown and 22mm lug width. Watch comes with outer and inner box, and warranty card. It does not have the leatehr strap, deployant or bracelet. But it does have the NATO in brand new unworn status. I have it on a cognac leather strap I will include as well as some other worn leather straps and an extra NATO.

You could ask the dealer, they can work out a deal where you return and pay your overage, but then they sell you the car below the residual value, closer to market. It's an easy sale for them with very good profit and you save money on a car that you know how it was driven and you like."

Skilled salespeople can manipulate some numbers to make a monthly payment happen, if you shop on monthly payment you are not doing it right. "
vc_wc,"But thats not what we got here. We got a few dealers doing as you describe, which is fair. And then one dealer, faking a lower price only to make it up on a fake fee line item. Its not the same. "
vc_wc,"its unlikely a dealer that has the lowest price would need to resort to hiding a dealer fee. But in the off case that they do, it prob wouldnt be that much.

I would prob walk and/or look really hard for other shady business. If you value your time and sanity, you are prob better off walking. But i get that im an outlier in that sense. "

**Description:**|This watch has a history deeply rooted in edc_r. I originally won it last year when it was raffled by Chan after he had just given it the old ‚Äúin and out‚Äù if you know what I mean. I then traded it and ended up winning it again when it was reraffled a few months later. Condition is excellent, especially for a watch from 1967. Everything seems original, but the bracelet you see in the photos is an aftermarket generic oyster bracelet meant for a more modern datejust. A brown leather strap along with a blue suede strap will also be included.

Yeah then you are in worse shape than i thought. You are def going to go over. I think its even less likely that they can do it but you might as well hear them out. "
vc_wc,"Total cost after the 36 payments. The Money factor and residual prob changed. The fact you have so little miles makes a difference. But why are you driving so little? 

They may be moving you to a ultra low miles lease (idk if they have it) for like 8k miles/yr and thats how they are making it work. Its not terrible as thats what you should have done the first time around"
vc_wc,"Did you put money down on the 2016? will the new lease be the same terms (miles)? 

What they would do is just buy it out and figured there is enough meat in a low mileage example of your car to have enough room to make up some of the cost of the new one. 

monthly payment is not the end all of a car deal, even more so in a lease IMO. "
vc_wc,"On a 3 year lease? 10k or 12k miles/year?

I still think it will cost you some $ but you are in a better spot than most so maybe its competitive.

What brand/model/year?"
vc_wc,You got 65
vc_wc,"Not common and pretty close to impossible. Even if it was somehow possible through some crazy incentives (or you had a silly down payment that you will now lose), you would still be out taxes, registration, and some fees. 

My guess is that its just some ploy to get you in and try to sell you another car. They might be able to match payments, thats the easy part. But you are not going to be better off financially. Now if you REALLY want the new car maybe you can listen to the offer."
vc_wc,"You got 78, 81"
vc_wc,"is it really the customer who has commoditized it?

I get your point and i dont disagree but the industry needs some introspection. The pendulum swung to price-driven due to the lack of service and value prop from brands and dealers. Now dealers also contribute to this cycle by targeting those folks and then complaining about it - whats wrong with passing on being on those people's radars?

I think there are ways to bring value and charge for it, but they do take a different approach and it does cost money. I think the luxury brands are better at this and in my limited experience it appears they have a larger percentage of customers that are willing to pay fair prices and not bottom dollar. 
"
vc_wc,"Good point. Some people prefer the manufacturer CPO, for better or worse. There are so many bad warranties out there as well, so for many people its a ""sure thing"" even if it costs more and may not cover as much. 

In my case I prefer a CPO because for some brands it is/was transferable, and also there are financial incentives or special rates for CPO. I am also talking about finding a car on your own and just bringing it in for that CPO"
vc_wc,"You got 12, 32"
vc_wc,You got 70
vc_wc,"Its an interesting point but its not a good comparison. None of them ask me to go to the stadium, venue, or airport and waste my time before finding out there are these other fees. 

Also, all these industries are regulated. Would dealers want that regulation so now they have to show it in all 3rd party outlets just like airlines, tickets, hotels, etc?"
vc_wc,"it does to some of us. Just as we are asked to consider the ""value"" from some dealers and pay more than bottom price. Then we should also consider shitty practices like this one and just bounce out and vote with our wallet right?"
vc_wc,"Its not just silly, i'd say its also dishonest. 

There are plenty of posts and answers about wasting the salesperson's time. How is this just ""silly""? Its a real waste of time, not only did i have to go to find out, but then i have to do the son and dance, they might even hide the keys to my trade-in. 

But i also lost the opportunity to buy a car elsewhere from someone more deserving. 

I agree with many posts here but I always question why the good salespeople here are so hesitant to call a shitty dealer practice as such. It takes away from all the other valid points made. "

vc_wc,I'll take a waitlist spot for 1 spot greedy /u/rivven1 doesnt want
vc_wc,"It actually is really nice. I thought the video would have been better if you showed the sweeping instead of moving the watch. 

It's got to be at half by the 12 hour limit. Idk if you would get there"
vc_wc,Wish you hadn't cancelled. Was going to buy a few spots. Stop can I think if you want to reopen
vc_wc,"Lol fuck yes. I'm not above taking a spot here.

Also, this is really great of you to do. Seriously, thanks. Hope karma paid you back.

Or maybe karma already paid you, lucky bastard!"
vc_wc,Lol remindme never
vc_wc,But did you save your wallet? Did you see the queue?
vc_wc,"I'll take 1 of the following in this order: #11, #22, #32, #23, or random if all taken.

I'll also take 1 random. 

2 total spots. Thanks!"
vc_wc,"I dont know about Toyota but i wish other stores had a ""fixed"" CPO price. I'd bring a private party car, i'll pay them a fixed fee for CPO plus anything they find that needs to be taken care of as long as its reasonably priced (tires, etc). "
vc_wc,"I know people say ""T A C T I C S"" sarcastically around here... but so can we now say TACTICS for real? Only fair, right? :)

Sorry OP, there doesnt seem to be such a thing from Honda, only ""programs"" from dealers, which dont really exist beyond them working out a deal for you based on your specific situation. Maybe a Honda salesperson here can help.

I think thats fine - it doesnt necessarily means it would be a bad deal, but if you were sold on it, and ""ok'd"" to drive over miles because of the program then I would argue it was not done in good faith. 

As someone else said, there will be pain to get out of it. Your best bet may be to just drive it to lease end and then buy it at the residual. Anything else is likely to cost you more. Unless some new Honda models have a lot of incentives maybe the dealer can get you into one with minimal pain, but i really doubt it. "
vc_wc,"Not OP but out of curiosity, does your store do any kind of inspection? 

I think its a fair price for the paperwork and time, etc.if they are taking care of payments and title transfers, registrations, etc etc. Is there any liability the store is taking when doing this? "
vc_wc,tag a roo
vc_wc,"Yeah there is no reason to put money down on a lease. Dont focus on the monthly payment, focus on the selling price. Just because its a lease it doesnt mean you cant work with the dealer on the best price.

As someone below said, there are risks with putting money down in case of a wreck, if you must put money down, ask about gap insurance. Some makes include it in their lease (BMW), but some dont.

If you want to limit your monthly, pay for the tax and registration and fees out of pocket instead of financing them."
vc_wc,"you and i are on the same page here. but as folks here will point out, we are in the minority. Used still better than new. If you can at least do your research and negotiate well you may limit how much you give back up in depreciation. 

"
vc_wc,"Even buying off a dealer, it is relatively better (than buying new). It might take a little more to break even or it may cost you more. I mean, 95% of the time it is a depreciating asset so no matter how you acquire it, it will lose value. The trick is finding the best balance of depreciation curve against time."
vc_wc,"Gotcha, well in that case you just have to be mentally (and financially) prepared to always have a lease payment, or have a long term plan to wean off it. 

My plan has been to buy a fun a car to be my long-term car. And when i want or need to get off the lease merry go round, i'll just drive that for a bit. If i were to save my lease payments for a year I could buy a used econobox in cash; if i save it for 2 years, i could buy a decent mid tier sedan with low miles in cash. if i save for 3 years i can prob buy an off-lease CPO luxury entry level. thats my plan, but for now, i continue to enjoy leasing.

As for buying used, my personal opinion is that not all CPOs are created equal. The CPO warranty is not always as good, and in the end I research cars equally, pre-purchase inspection, etc if they are CPO or not. While I do leases, my wife buys pre-owned so thats our process - and as dumb as it may sound to many, we have a pre-owned X5 that we bought just off lease and not CPOd. Saved a little upfront, and thats sitting in savings as our repair fund. We negotiated an extra year of maintenance and so far its been great."
vc_wc,"Scary responses. For all the technology vendors supporting the car business, I am surprised none of them offer a solution for PCI compliance.

On the other hand, forget PCI compliance... shredding social security numbers and not writing cards down or shredding them after should be SOP, regardless of PCI or not"
vc_wc,"I think a pay plan where there is an incentive to sell something is totally fine/great. But when there is a negative (instead of neutral) consequence to NOT selling something, it creates the potential for a bad environment and poor customer experience. "
vc_wc,"I dont know you but based on what you are saying, you dont seem a good lease candidate. 

A lease is good if you are someone that cant keep a car more than 3 years and drives a standard number of miles. You seem to be more of a buy and hold car buyer and if you try to do that with a lease, you are more likely to end up overpaying. There are a few instances, with some brands that play games with residuals, where you might be better off leasing and then buying it off, but thats unlikely. Side note, even brands that were good there like BMW set up rules to avoid the buyer getting a good deal on their own car. 

This is coming from someone that has been leasing for the last 20 years. Not a salesperson. 

If you are a little gun shy, you are better off buying a used vehicle that has already taken the depreciation hit. If you dont like it, you can sell it without losing much after a few payments (as long as you are not getting bamboozled on the price). At the very least, its better than buying new and being disappointed and taking the biggest depreciation hit.

In general terms, from a financial perspective, buying used is better than new unless you keep your new car for &gt; 7 years. A lease is good if you MUST have a new car every 2-3 years and dont mind constantly having a payment on a depreciating asset. It is better to do that than buy and sell every 3 years, thats a death spiral of negative equity."
vc_wc,i dont want any of those but i'll take something you are keeping lol
vc_wc,i dont see any fucking GIFs! bait and switch!
vc_wc,really? I didnt know. What do you have available for trade?
vc_wc,"Yes of course. This is the ""original"" 2016 version, ""original"" because its a homage to an original CK2998 lol

The 2016 is a more traditional speedy, the new 2018 version released this year has a pulsometer instead of tachymeter and it has red accents. It is pretty cool but I already have [this speedy panda with red accents](https://i.imgur.com/AANtVDT.jpg)."
vc_wc,Its for the Speedy raffle. I had the wrong title. 
vc_wc,"I had the wrong title, i got pulled into a meeting while I was editing. "

**Description:**| This was raffled a while back and I made the winner promise to give me first dibs if they wanted to let it go at some point. He followed through and I was able to pick it up from him a few months ago. This may be one of my favorite speedies, it definitely feels much more refined than any other speedy. The cream dial, blue subdials, applied markers, and awesome lume add up to an even nicer than expected watch. This watch comes as full set as you would have received it from the AD. It has the big case, the unworn steel bracelet, the blue croc leather strap, and of course box and papers. I'll add more pictures later today.

vc_wc,"Sorry brother, OP doesnt want to deal with potential delays"
vc_wc,"lol I like that you are a very frugal gambler. I guess every chip counts!

I got family that goes to Montreal to gamble, i just asked. They have conversion machines on the floor you can use as well as the cage. The rate there is pretty fair they said, the machines have a better rate than the cage by 1 cent. 

They get you when you convert back from CAD to USD. In the end they take about a 3% fee when you compared the sell/buy rates. You should check with your bank to see if they have a better rate and just bring CAD abck home and deposit into your bank.

The other comment is that you are most likely better off using a canada ATM machine and getting cash out in CAD directly - it will most likely have a better rate but with transaction fees it may be more expensive as you may have to do multiple withdrawals. "
vc_wc,"lol wtf blob. you were going to to go through all that trouble?

I am not sure i follow what you are trying to do. You basically need CAD in cash to gamble? Because for anything else, you are better off using your CC - one that has no foreign fees. Most places in Montreal already charge in USD anyway.

If you do need cash, you can bring USD cash across the border, go to any bank there and get CAD. If you are going gambling, bring the USD to the cage and they will exchange it. Its been a long time since i was there but you were allowed to buy-in with USD directly as well.

Sorry blob i dont follow"

Comes with all boxes and papers and is on OEM Black Alligator Grand Seiko strap. Watch is in great condition with no flaws or deep scratches. Is keeping excellent time in line with Grand Seiko standards. Dial is a white parchment paper treatment. If you wanted a GS Snowflake, this is a more affordable version of it. Watch also comes with a custom made horween leather strap that is in the pictures. Condition is the same as received.

vc_wc,I think that was someone from another sub. I dont even know what happened to it. I didnt really care for it to be honest. It was not helpful at all and just cluttered the thread. 
vc_wc,"got a ""home"" game in the city? i have only found a couple of 3-6 and 5-10. Would like to find some more"
vc_wc,where do you go?
vc_wc,"I used to be big on sports - quit that 8+ years ago while i was ahead - it was just so much work to research every game and line to find opportunities. 

Have always played poker and still do, mostly cash games. I do take trips to the casino and usually play craps and blackjack - and of course if im up big i like to jump on the high stakes slots machines. Used to play poker at casinos but now its so crowded and there are sharks at every table - it became too much of a grind, rather gamble on other stuff for fun."
vc_wc,Greek Drachmas?
vc_wc,Time to let it go now? let me know i'd be interested in it. Is it the SBGA011 or SBGA211?
vc_wc,"This. +1. If you are salty, take a fucking break for yourself. Or just unsubscribe. "
vc_wc,"It was around 4500 subs but many were ghosts not participating. We were told by older mods that the ""active"" number of subs was in the 500 range. 

You are not wrong but it has always been that way. Only some items drew casuals out of the woodwork and most of the time they didnt get spots because it went too fast. "
vc_wc,i know i have a couple of them that are 20/18 like yours. But I may have one that is 20/20 - let me check it out later and i'll let you know. Thanks bud! 
vc_wc,Nabs if you don't have use for it I have a bunch of 20mm Omega straps. I'll take it off your hands. How do you know it's fake? Just based on what you paid? I would mind reimbursing you for it
vc_wc,"Yeah.... Don't do that. We have all been there and done that. 

You are actually in decent shape given what you have won. 

And you have only been here since April. Some of us have been here since April last year lol. It's amazing how some of us are still around!"

**Description:**|This is new to 2018 with only 1,500 in existence. I snatched one up in May before my dealer sold out. Grand Seiko is celebrating the 20th anniversary of their highbeat 9S movement, which runs at a silky smooth 36,000 beats per hour or 10 per second. The automatic rotor is highly decorated to showcase this achievement. The dial is one of the most beautiful i‚Äôve ever seen with its intricate mosaic pattern. The dial plays in the sunlight, and can go from a bright blue to almost black. The GS logo and seconds hand is a warm gold color. It runs very well at -1 seconds per day. The watch is hand polished by master craftsmen using a special technique called Zaratsu polishing. It has both brushed and polished surfaces on multiple facets of the case, lugs and band.
** **|Hodinkee gives a much better description then I do: https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/grand-seiko-sbgh267-anniversary-introducing
** **|I purchased it one month ago at an authorised dealer for $8,700 CAD or $6,500 USD, and seeing how these are very scarce in existence, I would like to get back most of what I spent on it. The reason why I am selling is that I dipped into my savings when I really shouldnt of, and my bank account is not looking to good atm. Hence I am also selling my Planet Ocean along with this Grand Seiko. As ive worn it a dozen times at the office, its picked up some micro scratches. Nothing deep at all, just a few on the bracelet. I rate the watch at 95% original condition.

It comes with all the original accessories (nato strap, loupe, velcro strap), along with the warranty card and manuals (dated March 2016). The watch is in good condition, with a few nicks on the tachymeter and a few scratches on the side. There are quite a bit of hairline scratches are the polished bits on the lugs and the back of the watch. There are a lot of scratches on the underside of the lugs, due to me changing out the strap. The watch keeps good time and all the chrono functions work as normal.

But i went a little crazy, and picked up quite a few pieces. **[Here is my collection](https://imgur.com/a/Ex7TtRC)** as of last week. You may read below for some more detail:

###Current Collection

From Top Left in the winder spots:

* **[Rolex Submariner ""Hulk""](https://imgur.com/taqqXtB):** I lusted after this one for a long time, until I finally decided to pull the trigger. I found a great deal on a like-new recently bought example with full everything and just pulled the trigger. I am glad I did as it has become the crown jewel of the collection for now. 

* **[Rolex DateJust Turn-O-Graph ""Thunderbird""](https://imgur.com/bmYAtrl):** My first Rolex. And i had posted this one in my last SOTC - I was falling out of love with this one, but then I changed the bracelet to leather and fell in love with it again. It has been my de-facto dress watch. I just love the dial on this one - it has such a great reaction to light and different angles, its really stunning. The bidirectional bezel is 18k white gold and the reference has a pretty cool history behind it. 

* **[Omega Speedmaster The Legend Michael Schumacher 6th Title LE](https://imgur.com/AANtVDT):** Wife bought me [this sweet strap](https://imgur.com/ltLc3tK) and none of the watches I had were a good fit for it. The next day as I am browsing watches, as one obviously does, I come across this beauty. Basically a poor mans Newman Daytona. Also, it looks similar to the new CK2998 just release this year. I wasnt a big fan of the speedy reduced or other speedy autos, but this one is a little different - its a 42mm watch with the improved Cal 3301. downside? no quick date set. upside? Its an awesome looking watch.

* **[Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial](https://imgur.com/z500gh4):** This is one that I did not expect to get as I loved the older style version - but man what a pleasant surprise it was. I know the faux patina color is controversial, but it looks great and I dont even think about it that way - its just another lume color. The bezel is gorgeous and I love the quick hour set option. This one wears really well and feels much nicer in the metal. The 19mm lugs are a head scratcher though. 

* **[Panerai Luminor Marina](https://imgur.com/IIWHfLW):** Here once again I was fallign out of love, and you may have seen this one on /r/watchexchange - but once I put this one leather... wow. From the last SOTC - This is another one where I couldnt make up my mind and bought a black and white dialed version. This is a smaller 40mm (rare for Panerai) and it has a bright white dial with small seconds and pretty great lume. Having the date and cyclops is a bonus and IMO its cool that it is a flat cyclops in the crystal unlike others that protrude. 

* **[Panerai Luminor Marina](https://imgur.com/cWze8eh):** From the last SOTC - I had been lusting over a Panerai for a long time but I always had a hard time understanding the fanatic following. I love the look and thought it would be too big. But since i got this watch it has been one of, if not the, most worn watch in the collection - its just so damn comfortable. It has the right weight and presence and I have hard time thinking I would let this one go unless it was an upgrade in complications or power reserve. 

* **[IWC Aquatimer Chronograph](https://imgur.com/4vPVsnl):** This is a fairly recent addition - I was reading some articles and many people said, if you must have an IWC, this is the one you should check out. By chance, I came across a good deal on this one and decided to pull the trigger. First, the bracelet is maybe the most comfortable i have worn. A pain in the ass to size it properly but wears extremely well. The [lume on this thing is awesome](https://imgur.com/yI9X29e) and everything else about the watch is fantastic - a strong contender to be a 1 or 2 watch collection IMO.

* **[IWC Flieger Chronograph](https://imgur.com/lXcBMqX):** I got this one via trade. I can tell you that it wears true to its 39mm size and fits nicely. I really like the day-date complication and the readability of the hands. I changed it from the IWC black leather to this cheaper brown leather and I like it better as its more comfortable this way. For a while, this was the watch i wore when i got home as it was the most comfortable.


From Top Left in the static spots:

* **[Tudor Heritage Ranger](https://imgur.com/hWIHwyw):** I came across this one on /r/watchexchange and thought it would be a good way to hold off the lust for the Explorer I. Well, it did its job really well - its not the same but it is a field watch that has great presence, feels great on the wrist, super readable, and nice lume. It has fallen a little out of favor lately but I wore this last week and still think its a great watch, even better i think its great value for the money.

* **[Breitling SuperOcean](https://imgur.com/t7yJ6Zd):** This is a fairly recent addition. I have had a couple of Navitimers and they were big and flashy - someone told me to check out this line. I am glad I did - the detail in finishing is still there but it feels a lot more like a tool watch. This one quickly took over daily/beater type of status. It is readable, has great lume, it water rated, and its comfortable - Although the dial may seem a little busy, it is not.

* **[Omega Speedmaster Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/JmInsxu):** This is one of those that will not go anywheer. 18k white gold bezel, gorgeous cream dial and stunning blue broad arrow hands. Add a moonphase complication and a quick date and moon set and this is could easily be a collection of 1 - except for the lack of water rating. I acquired this one, and the one below, a couple of years ago at the same time. I had told myself that I would reward myself with a *nice* watch when I reached a professional milestone. When I did, it took me a year to figure out what to get - and when I finally did, i still couldnt make up my mind, which brings me to the next one.

* **[Omega Speedmaster Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/ByKAksL):** See above. This reference has the traditional speedy bezel and traditional hands, but i love the detail of the gold color rings around the subdials. It gives a little extra depth to the dial. These 2 moonphase references are so nice that I had to get them both. And you can't beat the sapphire caseback. **Update:** Just sold it :(

* **[Omega Speedmaster CK2998](https://imgur.com/tzQwcfO):** This is the CK2998 released last year - it has gorgeous blue and white dial - like a Panda but with this deep blue, and the white is a gorgeous cream color. The quality of the finishing on this one higher than any other Omega I have handled - outside of maybe the 3575.20 listed above.  It also has [really fantastic lume](https://imgur.com/vZ3aC7g). I dont care for the 19mm lug width but the blue crocodile Omega leather strap is phenomenal. I havent even had a chance to put it on the bracelet because the leather wears so well.

* **[Omega Seamaster 300M](https://imgur.com/FtgmsBC):** Got this on a whim recently because I missed the older style seamaster and this was offered to me at a great price. I love the deep black dial and the ceramic bezel though the 41mm feels a little bigger. I really like a lot of the details here, the red lettering, the date window looks great, and the hands recall the style of the older versions. No complaints here.

* **[Nomos Tangente Datum Gangreserve](https://imgur.com/mAEfyre):** I feel bad about this one - I had been chasing the Nomos Metro version with no luck. This one fell on my lap at a very attractive price and figured I would give it a whirl. Now, this is a great watch. Beautiful finish, the caseback showcases a beautiful movement, and it is very thin. As a dress watch is really great. But I was unfair to it, the 35mm is a little tough for me to get used to. I do love the blue hands, the date window position is great and of course the power reserve display is very cool. As you see in the pic, i considered putting it up for sale almost immediately after acquiring it - but I am still not 100%. Its likely going to go as its not getting worn, but I am still chasing the right Nomos watch.

* **[Nomos Club Datum](https://imgur.com/BKDEU62):** Similar to the above - i figured I would give this version a try. This one has a more comfortable size at 38.5mm - and it still has all the Nomos characteristics. The orange hands and details on the dial, make the watch a more casual choice and as such it serves a nice purpose. I have enjoyed wearing this a few times, but it doesnt completely scratch that Nomos itch.

* **[Glash√ºtte Original Vintage](https://imgur.com/YlXlEfR):** I dont know much about this one but I tried to learn more - I am pretty sure this is considered a ""senator"" and it is stamped with the GUB marks from the time when Germany was dealing with post war effects. This checked several boxes: vintage, dress, german. Its a very cool watch with a gorgeous dial, and my favorite part are the hour markers. This is the inspiration for the new GO ""sixties"" release - I love the simplicity of the manual wind and it runs fantastic!

vc_wc,oh hey Nabs whats cracking?
vc_wc,I might be interested in a spot or buying it outright. Pictures?
vc_wc,"yeah many people say so. I like them, but they are not grail status for me. I might pick one up but I just dont see it taking a lot of wrist time. Now that I sold the black dial moonphase maybe I will try it"
vc_wc,"Its a vintage  Glasshutte Original - I put it all here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/8ua0yl/sotc_yes_i_have_a_problem/e1do2z1/"

vc_wc,Totally agree - thats the next step here. Clear those that dont get worn often enough to justify or those that dont fit my lifestyle as well. Hope that I can clear enough funds to upgrade to one of those.  Thank you for the comment
vc_wc,Ha! We were just looking at umbrella recently. Thank you!
vc_wc,"Its one just like this one: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder

I didnt buy it there but looks like the same one"
vc_wc,ha! yeah that would be nice but i'd have to clear some of these first.
vc_wc,"Thank you!

I answered this elsewhere but some times I start with a watch i want to wear for some reason, but most often its a combination of activities I will do that day, weather (hot? rain? snow?), location (safe vs dangerous, vs likely to incur damage), and clothes/fashion.

I basically take all of these into a shit equation in my brain and it outputs a choice of 1 or 2 watches and I just grab one. The details of the watch matter, chrono or not, date? water rating. Lume? leather or bracelet? dial and band color, etc"
vc_wc,Ha! Thank you! A JLC MUT would be nice
vc_wc,very nice. yeah thats sweet lume. It looks identical to mine except for the yellow vs white. I dont know if there are any differences to be honest. 
vc_wc,No worries. Good luck with your search. Which one were you referring to? The moonphase black dial? 
vc_wc,"Its one just like this: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder
"
vc_wc,"That's awesome. I had not seen that. They are not wrong, he can do whatever he wants"
vc_wc,I don't know. I never heard that and I never had a kinetic
vc_wc,"i never had a Doxa, wouldnt mind trying one. Also an eterna would be cool to check out"
vc_wc,I got it from an intl seller but here is one just like it: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder
vc_wc,"haha, yeah i dont think that one will make it to a raffle.

The first criteria will be if its easy to replace if i miss it. That white Panerai is hard to get at a good price"
vc_wc,true but chrono 24 has inflated prices. I prefer to deal with private sellers
vc_wc,lol yeah good luck with that I'd like some of those too
vc_wc,lol STFU you have been winning everything. You just want to take all my watches. im onto you.
vc_wc,"Alright, i like it. So define Haute horology - it cant be just in-house movements right? that would include rolex and others. 

I just got this modern GO so I will put that statement to the test. I always wanted one so it will get a fair shake but the values are all up there - not many bargains to be had. "
vc_wc,Thanks man and i agree. Thats the next step is to move up a little on it and figure out how to consolidate some of these into an upgrade. 
vc_wc,Thank you!
vc_wc,"Absolutely. There is one on watchex right now, and also a patek worldtimer. so tempted... but i would have to sell at least half of these"
vc_wc,"Thank you!

You got it right, i cruise /r/watchexchange and watchrecon for good deals and if its something that I like and I can get a good deal on, I'll jump on it. The downside is that I am supposed to sell something first, and i havent been doing that."
vc_wc,Yes I;d like to add a patek and/or an ALS. I have never been into the rectangle/square watches but have been growing interest in trying one. Maybe a JLC reverso.
vc_wc,"I like it. I have not seen the yellow one in person, and i think the yellow one is newer? I am not as familiar with the references there as I only got it recently. 

How does the Lume work on yours? Mine looks like [this](https://imgur.com/yI9X29e)"
vc_wc,i bought mine off instagram and i cant find the place anymore - it was from holland. But someone else found one just like it here: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder
vc_wc,yeah its pretty cool and its well built. But it was big and heavy. Maybe better on the rubber but the bracelet made it heavy - and it also looked awesome.
vc_wc,"there are some watch specific shots in my comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/8ua0yl/sotc_yes_i_have_a_problem/e1do2z1/

Wish it wasnt getting buried"
vc_wc,"if its the same as mine, its worth the money. Mine runs well and quietly in the bedroom. "
vc_wc,"You are not wrong. I have been wearing the TOG, the vintage GO, and the Nomos Tangente as dress pieces but wish i had something more formal. I'd like to get an ALS or Patek."
vc_wc,Damn. Nice piece. I might research you and your group a bit. I'm about to go and consolidate my collection in order to upgrade a few pieces. Hope you find your buyer. If not I might be able to trade some stuff that you might be able to move quicker at better margins
vc_wc,thank you and good luck!
vc_wc,if only you would rig the bot to pick my number more often...
vc_wc,Thanks bud! I wish more people read the actual post. Next time I'll figure out how to put it in the OP so it doesnt get voted down lol
vc_wc,lol actually the irony is that i didnt get started really collecting until after our daughter was born. Will be 1 yr old next month!
vc_wc,This 100%
vc_wc,Yes you can add them but they are typically a higher deductible since you must use your more insurance
vc_wc,"Only a few hundred bucks from here: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder

Not where i bought mine, but appears to be the same."
vc_wc,Thank you. State Of The Collection
vc_wc,not nearly as much as it may appear based on dealer's prices. 
vc_wc,"Totally - i have been really bad at setting the time after travelling. So even though i put them back on the winder, they dont get set properly until the next time i wear them. "
vc_wc,"A few people have asked. Another redditor found this one: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder

It looks the same, i bought mine off instagram"
vc_wc,"Thank you, i appreciate it"
vc_wc,"I dont know who makes the box, but another redditor found this one that looks very much like it. https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder"
vc_wc,I am definitely missing a Grand Seiko. And to be honest I still want to know what all the fuzz is about the Alpinist but i aint paying the crazy prices they go for nowadays
vc_wc,Thank you! Very kind.
vc_wc,"Really good point and something that i have had in mind as of late. This is part of my next move consolidating.

Thankfully, many of these are either Valjoux 7750 movements which are very affordable to service, or Omega which have fairly simple servicing process. Definitely something to consider when maintaining a collection"
vc_wc,Thanks man. I wish you the best of luck!
vc_wc,"I actually really liked it. But it was massive. In a good way. In the end, it was just more watch than I needed for my desk diving everyday - i guess thats true for all divers but the Stowa was big. I couldnt wear it to the office with a straight face. But i did like it, the bracelet was great."
vc_wc,Yes sir. Thats my plan. I have a few upcoming watches - after that I'll decide what I am going to keep and then sell some to fund some upgrades.
vc_wc,Yeah - I took this after a long trip. I had disconnected the winder and had taken a few with me. I'll take an updated photo
vc_wc,lol pls dont rob me
vc_wc,This is why I post to reddit. Good idea - might look into it
vc_wc,someone found this one that looks just like it. I assume its the same one but i bought it from Holland: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder
vc_wc,thanks man
vc_wc,points for trying! :)
vc_wc,haha. thanks!
vc_wc,"Someone here found one like it here: https://www.watchboxco.com/collections/eight-watch-winders/products/diplomat-burl-wood-eight-watch-winder

It looks like its the same one, but i dont know"
vc_wc,"lol are you offering?

oh and happy cakeday to you as well!"
vc_wc,Oh and at this point - it will be 3575.20 (white dial moonphase speedy) and most likely the hulk. The wife loves the Schumacher panda speedy so that one prob stays. I think everything else could go if needed. 
vc_wc,"Thank you!

It all really started with the 2 Omega Speedy Moonphase (white and black dials). I couldnt make up my mind on which one i liked and i bought both. That was the first indication that this would be a problem."
vc_wc,"Everytime I see a Sinn I consider getting them. I think they are nice watches and worth the money, but me being me, i want to get a deal, and those are hard to come by. And thank you!"
vc_wc,I agree with you and its definitely fun. I wish they kept making it and improving it. 
vc_wc,"yeah how do you think i ended up here. Half of these were ""oh i'll just sell the other one"". And i never did. I look forward to your SOTC"
vc_wc,I dont disagree with you here. I am hoping to correct that and pick up the BB Pepsi GMT 
vc_wc,"Meh, I dont really care. We all have an idea - no need to say it. You would hope that people care about the item itself not just about the cost."
vc_wc,This may be the best money-related comment so far. 
vc_wc,Thank you!
vc_wc,Thanks man!
vc_wc,Ha! glad you noticed - Except for the Omegas. 
vc_wc,"Thank you! No, actually none of those were bought new. Its like buying a car, depreciation hits as soon as you walk out the door. All of these are 2nd hand, most of them were bought from the first owner. The closest to new is the Hulk which i bought from someone that had just bought 6 months earlier"
vc_wc,"haha. thank you. Hypothetically, probably the one that is most likely to hold value. Somewhere between the Hulk and one of the Speedmasters."
vc_wc,LOL I am sure you would. Thats def not the problem though
vc_wc,Thank you!
vc_wc,Oh and definitely the Hulk has been getting the most wrist time since i got it. 
vc_wc,haha - no. but there is a very convoluted process in my head to pick the watch i'll wear. I also very often change watches when i get home from work or over the weekend.
vc_wc,Its a perfect setting. i also timed it so i dont have to worry about having to pause or stop in order to get a watch. It works for me so far.
vc_wc,"Haha - too  much of a good thing can be a bad thing? maybe?
"
vc_wc,"yes, yes it would but the vintage world scares me a little because i dont know enough"
vc_wc,"I'll say that I use /r/watchexchange quite a bit, but I also do a lot of private party buying either from WUS or others. I also look at estate sales and auctions to see if i can get a deal"
vc_wc,"Makes sense - i never thought i was a chrono guy, but reality says differently. For whatever reason i always end up with chrono versions. Maybe i think im getting an extra complication for free. lol

I havent bought anything off an AD - though that may change. I mostly deal with private parties."
vc_wc,"hey man, thank you!"
vc_wc,whats in your collection nowadays?
vc_wc,"Thank man, I hope so too. I think the next step is to make some room first, thats where it gets tough!"
vc_wc,Thank you! Its interesting that many people seem to ask the same question. Is there something about the white that people dont like or that think it might reduce its wrist time? I am curious. 
vc_wc,"ha! For whatever reason, everytime i think of taking a wrist shot for it, i realize that i am not wearing a speedy on Tuedays. Weird. "
vc_wc,Those were the original 2! And thank you!
vc_wc,Thank you sir!
vc_wc,"Because im a cheap bastard? ha!

No - I would like to get one but i dont know which one. I have not spent enough time learning about it so I havent jumped in. Also, there are not as many opportunities to get them at good prices and thats one of my requirements. I do see some older ones and thats where i may start."
vc_wc,This guy here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/8ua0yl/sotc_yes_i_have_a_problem/e1dqsox/ found a box just like it. I bought mine off instagram and paid about the same.
vc_wc,thanks man!
vc_wc,in my business? about 15 years
vc_wc,LOL you go first
vc_wc,ding ding ding
vc_wc,Not rich by any means. But I am fairly disciplined and i make choices others may not. 
vc_wc,"you are not wrong. but the minute i put money into a savings or investment account - its out of bounds. I wont touch it - the whole benefit is in compound interest and length of time - taking the interest would negate it. 

But, i might come up with a solution like it because these are also not making any $ sitting there or on my wrist. Its a balance though."
vc_wc,ah sorry - the box i got from an instagram seller from the netherlands. Someone else in the comments found an identical one for a very competitive price. 
vc_wc,"You would think so! I have been looking but man, they are all priced pretty high"
vc_wc,"Thanks man, thats actually what I tend to be drawn to. I like those that are different, even slightly, or uncommon. Thanks for noticing!"
vc_wc,"there are 2 main schools of thought here - i dont think either one has been definitely proven as the right one.

Either, the winder adds wear and tear to the watch - not different than if you wore it as a daily. So it may accelerate the service periods - or so they say.

The other view is that letting automatic watches sit unworn allows the oils to dry up and can create damage. Also, in some cases there may be extra wear from having to wind them to start again and wear in having to set the time and date constantly. I also dont know if that is actually the case.

I decided that under the current setup, it winds for 3 hours and rests for 9 hours, i am comfortable with whats doing. It beats having to wind every watch by hand or constantly be setting them up. "
vc_wc,"haha. the thing with guns is, you have to shoot them. so you have to buy bullets and they are not cheap. Its like if you had to pay for every minute you wear your watch"
vc_wc,very nice. The black dial it definitely dresses it up
vc_wc,errr... sorry? 
vc_wc,ha! I answered elsewhere - i am in NYC working in technology/marketing/digital
vc_wc,LOL thank you prosciutto lover
vc_wc,"Good question - I think some/many of these pieces dont have immediate upgrade paths. But in general I'd like to get a Patek, AP, ALS, FP Journe - im not saying all, but experience some of their pieces. 

right now im still searching for a snowflake GS, and I want a JLC MUT. 

There is a big gap in the collection, no GMT so I'd like that - i have been keeping an eye on a Pepsi, might try the new Tudor. I would also like a birth year watch. So there is plenty to chase."
vc_wc,"Thank you, very kind!"
vc_wc,"The one i sold is the gray/black dial and I wanted the traditional white and the gangreserve. I have seen the Ahoi, I am not sure maybe i'll give it a 2nd look"
vc_wc,"haha. well bills are paid but still. Shit, the boxes and papers are taking over a closet. And I tend to save the packaging in case i have to ship them so thats taking over the garage lol"
vc_wc,"lol - the moonphases are manual. The winder aint doing much for those. 

I had to make tough choices and the 3 autos left out are the Ranger (time only), Breitling (Date), and the Seamaster (date). "
vc_wc,"haha! totally man, i have been trying to stay away from here and watchex as it only creates more trouble lol"
vc_wc,thank you!
vc_wc,"Its the Schumacher Legend 6th Title Limited Edition. Cool right? Its not the most expensive, but not a lot of them in the wild. It definitely checks several boxes"
vc_wc,"Thank you. 

You nailed it with the Breitling. It like asks to be worn daily and hard. I find myself picking it up often when im likely to do work around the house. "
vc_wc,Thank you. I appreciate it
vc_wc,LMAO Dammit. You either have great memory or you saved it somewhere. Its really accurate. LOL. Where have you been?
vc_wc,LOL you may have to do a little better
vc_wc,thank you!
vc_wc,thank you!
vc_wc,Thank you! I am still on a couple of lists for the Hulk and I would get one with my name on the card cause it might be a lifetime watch that gets passed on. 
vc_wc,"How do you like that IWC? I love the traditional clean pilot look. Very nice.

I think there are so many options for divers, its really hard to decide."
vc_wc,lol you are very kind
vc_wc,"Thank you, and yeah its an older model. Ref 39-31-11-13-04 - I am pretty sure.

The schumacher legend is really awesome - they went a little crazy with all the Schumacher models but this one is the one i like the best.

I do love speedies, particularly unique ones. I'd love a few others like a snoopy, apollo anniv, etc but you cant get those at competitive prices - they all have a premium"
vc_wc,yeah thats a good idea - they will prob try to sell me an umbrella though
vc_wc,Thank you!
vc_wc,"lol its very possible. i have been on the fence about it but i think I have to let it go. In the end, I have too many speedies"
vc_wc,"Not sure if you are kinda joking or if you mean a traditional speedy.

I have thought about it and i have been curious - but I feel that it may just compete for the same wrist time that the other speedmasters have. I recently let go of the speedy moonphase black, and i have thought about replacing with a traditional speedy. But, i dont know. I like them a lot I just dont know if I would wear it often"
vc_wc,Welcome to my world my friend... I try to run out of the room as soon as I pick one in case 2nd thoughts creep in
vc_wc,Someone in the comments found a link to one like it. I paid about the same which is closer to $300 - so yeah it looks nice than it is. Definitely a Wolf winder would be a grand or 2.
vc_wc,"Thank you. I cant pick a favorite, they all have something I really enjoy"
vc_wc,i am in the process of that actually. the built up was quicker than i had expected but i was recommended Jewelers Mutual - any others?
vc_wc,"LOL totally

""not my fault you dont take any interest in my hobbies!""

Ha!"
vc_wc,"Burn!

lol - thank you! and i really like the TOG, at one point i was feeling meh about it, but switching to leather made a huge difference. It felt like a new watch and I love the look of the bezel and the sunburst blue dial. "
vc_wc,"well, at any time there are only a handful of snowflakes. But its really hard to get them a decent price. My take on watches is that they depreciate, but you can slow down that depreciation by buying at the right price.

But yes, I will add a GS soon"
vc_wc,"Hey bud, i didnt want to tag you in this one. But yeah i still have it. I would prob send it to you first or let you know if it had to go. It still gets some wrist time!
"
vc_wc,"No favorite - I like/love them all for different reasons and situations. There is also the background behind the purchase, the reasons why, or how it came about so each has some meaning. 

Oh man, i feel like im probably crazy but the watch choice is prob the hardest every morning. Some times I start with a watch i want to wear for some reason, but most often is a combination of activities I will do, weather (hot? rain? snow?), location (safe vs dangerous, vs likely to incur damage), and clothes/fashion. 

I basically take all of these into a shit equation in my brain and it outputs a choice of 1 or 2 watches and I just grab one. The details of the watch matter, chrono or not, date? water rating. Lume? leather or bracelet? dial and band color, etc"
vc_wc,Thank you!
vc_wc,Thanks I appreciate it
vc_wc,Thank you!
vc_wc,Thanks!
vc_wc,"LOL thank you. I change watches almost every day when I get home from work. On the weekends I change watches at least once. Shit, I sometimes change watches to grill - gotta use that chrono"
vc_wc,"I am in Technology / Digital / Marketing - a combination of all those basically. Not really crazy like finance. I am just an opportunistic buyer - which is why there is no theme to the collection, and also why i dont have certain watches I would like, but i will only get at certain price points"
vc_wc,ha! I think thats where my wife would draw the line
vc_wc,thank you sir. i appreciate it
vc_wc,lol for some reason this joke never gets old to me
vc_wc,"i mean if you go by chrono 24 probably not far off, but if you look at bottom market prices on private sales not so much. It is still a lot of money, and thats my least favorite part of the hobby. Many days I wake up thinking that i should clear most of my collection and I can put the money to work elsewhere."
vc_wc,"The struggle is real. 

To be fair, some of them do struggle to get wrist time and I have to purposely grab them. But they all fill a niche - whether because the are a better match to what I will be doing, or match what im wearing better, or even fit better the company I will hang out with. "
vc_wc,"Thanks!

All the opposite actually. I REALLY like them. I have been chasing a snowflake, either the old or new version. I also like some of the others but I prefer a spring drive over a quartz - unless the dial is just bonkers gorgeous like the peacock. 

In a way, the GS is harder to obtain at good prices - everyone keeps their, those that come up are priced to maximize value. The Snowflake right now is priced used in a way that you are better off buying new. "
vc_wc,Can't wait for the next game shenanigans
vc_wc,NYC
vc_wc,"people post ALS, AP, PP, etc all the time as well"
vc_wc,Insurance - plus i mean sure it could happen but I think the odds are pretty low. Its more likely some local low life breaks in looking for its next fix. 
vc_wc,thank you but not that close. prob about 50% if you go by watchex prices
vc_wc,lol thats how i feel some days
vc_wc,it was a fairly cheap box from Amazon - I dont think its worth many beanie babies
vc_wc,"Ha! thanks. No my birthday, but my reddit birthday I guess"
vc_wc,"wow nice find. I didnt buy it here but it looks identical. My guess is that its a generic chinese box and branded by diff companies selling it online. I will look around, this is just a little less than what I paid after it was shipped to me from Holland."
vc_wc,lol I am in tech/digital/marketing - i would tell you but i'd have to kill you
vc_wc,"lol Sorry - right now its used to hold watch tools, extra straps, bracelets, etc. And if ever downsize the collection enough, I might need it. "
vc_wc,"Best part of Argentina going through, more games with Maradona on the stands"
vc_wc,ah i know the feeling. I had been meaning to post this for a while. 
vc_wc,nice! Heading to Sat night's game in the Bronx - hoping for a big win and some long ball from Mookie!
vc_wc,"Thanks! 

Once i switched the PAM to leather - it became a different watch and yeah it gets its fair share. "
vc_wc,Shameless Plus - Its my cakeday so I posted my [SOTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/8ua0yl/sotc_yes_i_have_a_problem/) to /r/watches
vc_wc,Thanks bud. When are you posting yours? Your wife has a nice collection so I am sure yours is pretty nice as well
vc_wc,LMAO. I havent seen that - and as a sox fan I would be really confused
vc_wc,Thank you! I have been fortunate. Your time will come as well
vc_wc,I picked it up off instagram from a seller in Holland. It was very affordable and seems to be holding up well. The winders have multiple settings and I have not had any problem with it
vc_wc,Thank you! If it wasnt too tacky i would wear 2 at a time lol
vc_wc,Ha! I do have a smaller watchbox that is now in storage. If i put it out I would be tempted to fill it as well. 
vc_wc,"Thank you!

I do my best to rotate through them. The hulk and CK2998 have been getting a fair amount of wrist time. Followed by the TOG and Speedies. But you will be surprised as I fairly often change watches in the same day - and I usually travel with 2-4 watches depending on the length of travel."

##Thank you for reading!

Obviously, many of these will end up going as I think a collection like this is unsustainable in the long term. But I have enjoyed having them all and I continue to figure out what I like and dont like. "
vc_wc,"Hello /r/watches I figured this would be a good time to do an update as i think I have peaked or hit rock bottom depending on your view. I posted back in December about [how my first year of collecting had gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/7k8hlq/sotc_the_first_year/) and oh boy things have changed since then. Once again, not a real theme to it other than learning and picking up stuff i liked and then figuring out stuff I didnt like. But i went a little crazy, and picked up quite a few pieces. **[Here is my collection](https://imgur.com/a/Ex7TtRC)** as of last week. You may read below for some more detail:

###Current Collection

From Top Left in the winder spots:

* **[Rolex Submariner ""Hulk""](https://imgur.com/taqqXtB):** I lusted after this one for a long time, until I finally decided to pull the trigger. I found a great deal on a like-new recently bought example with full everything and just pulled the trigger. I am glad I did as it has become the crown jewel of the collection for now. 

* **[Rolex DateJust Turn-O-Graph ""Thunderbird""](https://imgur.com/bmYAtrl):** My first Rolex. And i had posted this one in my last SOTC - I was falling out of love with this one, but then I changed the bracelet to leather and fell in love with it again. It has been my de-facto dress watch. I just love the dial on this one - it has such a great reaction to light and different angles, its really stunning. The bidirectional bezel is 18k white gold and the reference has a pretty cool history behind it. 

* **[Omega Speedmaster The Legend Michael Schumacher 6th Title LE](https://imgur.com/AANtVDT):** Wife bought me [this sweet strap](https://imgur.com/ltLc3tK) and none of the watches I had were a good fit for it. The next day as I am browsing watches, as one obviously does, I come across this beauty. Basically a poor mans Newman Daytona. Also, it looks similar to the new CK2998 just release this year. I wasnt a big fan of the speedy reduced or other speedy autos, but this one is a little different - its a 42mm watch with the improved Cal 3301. downside? no quick date set. upside? Its an awesome looking watch.

* **[Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial](https://imgur.com/z500gh4):** This is one that I did not expect to get as I loved the older style version - but man what a pleasant surprise it was. I know the faux patina color is controversial, but it looks great and I dont even think about it that way - its just another lume color. The bezel is gorgeous and I love the quick hour set option. This one wears really well and feels much nicer in the metal. The 19mm lugs are a head scratcher though. 

* **[Panerai Luminor Marina](https://imgur.com/IIWHfLW):** Here once again I was fallign out of love, and you may have seen this one on /r/watchexchange - but once I put this one leather... wow. From the last SOTC - This is another one where I couldnt make up my mind and bought a black and white dialed version. This is a smaller 40mm (rare for Panerai) and it has a bright white dial with small seconds and pretty great lume. Having the date and cyclops is a bonus and IMO its cool that it is a flat cyclops in the crystal unlike others that protrude. 

* **[Panerai Luminor Marina](https://imgur.com/cWze8eh):** From the last SOTC - I had been lusting over a Panerai for a long time but I always had a hard time understanding the fanatic following. I love the look and thought it would be too big. But since i got this watch it has been one of, if not the, most worn watch in the collection - its just so damn comfortable. It has the right weight and presence and I have hard time thinking I would let this one go unless it was an upgrade in complications or power reserve. 

* **[IWC Aquatimer Chronograph](https://imgur.com/4vPVsnl):** This is a fairly recent addition - I was reading some articles and many people said, if you must have an IWC, this is the one you should check out. By chance, I came across a good deal on this one and decided to pull the trigger. First, the bracelet is maybe the most comfortable i have worn. A pain in the ass to size it properly but wears extremely well. The [lume on this thing is awesome](https://imgur.com/yI9X29e) and everything else about the watch is fantastic - a strong contender to be a 1 or 2 watch collection IMO.

* **[IWC Flieger Chronograph](https://imgur.com/lXcBMqX):** I got this one via trade. I can tell you that it wears true to its 39mm size and fits nicely. I really like the day-date complication and the readability of the hands. I changed it from the IWC black leather to this cheaper brown leather and I like it better as its more comfortable this way. For a while, this was the watch i wore when i got home as it was the most comfortable.


From Top Left in the static spots:

* **[Tudor Heritage Ranger](https://imgur.com/hWIHwyw):** I came across this one on /r/watchexchange and thought it would be a good way to hold off the lust for the Explorer I. Well, it did its job really well - its not the same but it is a field watch that has great presence, feels great on the wrist, super readable, and nice lume. It has fallen a little out of favor lately but I wore this last week and still think its a great watch, even better i think its great value for the money.

* **[Breitling SuperOcean](https://imgur.com/t7yJ6Zd):** This is a fairly recent addition. I have had a couple of Navitimers and they were big and flashy - someone told me to check out this line. I am glad I did - the detail in finishing is still there but it feels a lot more like a tool watch. This one quickly took over daily/beater type of status. It is readable, has great lume, it water rated, and its comfortable - Although the dial may seem a little busy, it is not.

* **[Omega Speedmaster Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/JmInsxu):** This is one of those that will not go anywheer. 18k white gold bezel, gorgeous cream dial and stunning blue broad arrow hands. Add a moonphase complication and a quick date and moon set and this is could easily be a collection of 1 - except for the lack of water rating. I acquired this one, and the one below, a couple of years ago at the same time. I had told myself that I would reward myself with a *nice* watch when I reached a professional milestone. When I did, it took me a year to figure out what to get - and when I finally did, i still couldnt make up my mind, which brings me to the next one.

* **[Omega Speedmaster Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/ByKAksL):** See above. This reference has the traditional speedy bezel and traditional hands, but i love the detail of the gold color rings around the subdials. It gives a little extra depth to the dial. These 2 moonphase references are so nice that I had to get them both. And you can't beat the sapphire caseback. **Update:** Just sold it :(

* **[Omega Speedmaster CK2998](https://imgur.com/tzQwcfO):** This is the CK2998 released last year - it has gorgeous blue and white dial - like a Panda but with this deep blue, and the white is a gorgeous cream color. The quality of the finishing on this one higher than any other Omega I have handled - outside of maybe the 3575.20 listed above.  It also has [really fantastic lume](https://imgur.com/vZ3aC7g). I dont care for the 19mm lug width but the blue crocodile Omega leather strap is phenomenal. I havent even had a chance to put it on the bracelet because the leather wears so well.

* **[Omega Seamaster 300M](https://imgur.com/FtgmsBC):** Got this on a whim recently because I missed the older style seamaster and this was offered to me at a great price. I love the deep black dial and the ceramic bezel though the 41mm feels a little bigger. I really like a lot of the details here, the red lettering, the date window looks great, and the hands recall the style of the older versions. No complaints here.

* **[Nomos Tangente Datum Gangreserve](https://imgur.com/mAEfyre):** I feel bad about this one - I had been chasing the Nomos Metro version with no luck. This one fell on my lap at a very attractive price and figured I would give it a whirl. Now, this is a great watch. Beautiful finish, the caseback showcases a beautiful movement, and it is very thin. As a dress watch is really great. But I was unfair to it, the 35mm is a little tough for me to get used to. I do love the blue hands, the date window position is great and of course the power reserve display is very cool. As you see in the pic, i considered putting it up for sale almost immediately after acquiring it - but I am still not 100%. Its likely going to go as its not getting worn, but I am still chasing the right Nomos watch.

* **[Nomos Club Datum](https://imgur.com/BKDEU62):** Similar to the above - i figured I would give this version a try. This one has a more comfortable size at 38.5mm - and it still has all the Nomos characteristics. The orange hands and details on the dial, make the watch a more casual choice and as such it serves a nice purpose. I have enjoyed wearing this a few times, but it doesnt completely scratch that Nomos itch.

* **[Glash√ºtte Original Vintage](https://imgur.com/YlXlEfR):** I dont know much about this one but I tried to learn more - I am pretty sure this is considered a ""senator"" and it is stamped with the GUB marks from the time when Germany was dealing with post war effects. This checked several boxes: vintage, dress, german. Its a very cool watch with a gorgeous dial, and my favorite part are the hour markers. This is the inspiration for the new GO ""sixties"" release - I love the simplicity of the manual wind and it runs fantastic!

**Description:**| Recently bought this and a black Explorer II. Decided to keep the black one. This comes with a wave Rolex box, Explorer I/II instruction booklet, hang tag, two extra links, polishing cloth, and warranty card holder (no card). I am 99% sure the box/card holder are from a more modern Rolex. The crystal is flawless with no edge blemishes, case looks great without any pitting, case back looks to have been polished at one point (the brushed part seems to indicate this), lugs are pretty sharp for a 19 year old watch so if this was polished, it was very lightly. In comparison to the black one I recently picked up, the lugs could be considered very sharp considering the age. Bracelet is near-mint condition with minimal blemishes, clasp works great but the secondary fliplock seems a tad loose (easy 10-second fix). SEL bracelet with brand new Everest ""Rolex"" no-holes spring bars which keeps the bracelet nice and snug to the case. Movement is running great and winds beautifully smooth; keeping good time. Dial is flawless.

vc_wc,"So the watch is rated for 200m, but the bezel will only help you up to 60m? 

It's cool for sure. I'd like to see other examples. "
vc_wc,"Hmmm. Tell me about the bezel. I don't get it. The distances between numbers are not equal, so... 

I'll feel like an idiot when someone explains it to me"

vc_wc,PM incoming
vc_wc,Thanks for the tag!
vc_wc,Nice collection Nabs! Love the dornbluth and the railmaster. That Sinn is very cool as well!
vc_wc,"Dude - write your own description instead of copying mine. Also, your description should reflect the watch you are selling.

* Yours doesnt have a bracelet - it only has a leather strap

* Therefore it doesnt taper at the clasp

* Thats a huge difference - especially for Breitling as the bracelets are expensive

* ""feels smaller than the Panerai"" - what Panerai?

If you insist on using the same description, the least you can do is ask. "
vc_wc,"We can agree on that. 

But I do take exception of how it was decided without community feedback. I may have missed it, but i asked and i didnt see anything about it. 

"
vc_wc,"Thats fair, but thats just 1 use case. 

Sometimes i like to browse as you describe, but i never had an issue ignoring WTB posts. Sometimes the WTB posts drew me to learn about an item or check prices.

As a seller, posts are going to flow up/down naturally. It is rare that a WTB post pushes WTS posts down, unless the WTS items are not as interesting. And they would have fallen anyway. 

If anything I'd argue that the default sort should be by ""new"" and it avoids all issues with getting pushed up or down. 

I'll say that as a buyer and seller - the utility of the sub goes considerably down if the WTB are forced in the meta sticky.
"
vc_wc,"Ok - so whats the problem we are actually trying to solve?

Is it low quality posts? then force the need for an image, a name, and maybe location? price doesnt make sense but you can set a max price if you want. 
I have never posted a WTB without an image, it looks like shit and it doesnt help anyone. 

On the other hand maybe we should let the sub work as intended. Low quality posts get downvoted and out of the home page. Good posts get upvoted. Some people sort by new and see all. I still fail to see the issue. 

Isnt the argument in your last sentence the same now, as the meta thread makes it harder for buyers to find the item they seek and for sellers to find the right buyers that are ""ready"" to purchase. Instead of the million tire kickers that are drawn.

If the problem is that there are more WTB posts than WTS, thats a different story. 

if its filtering, you can just type [WTS], [WTB], or [WTT] in the search field. I have always used it that way already so i guess I thought it was common usage in most trade subs. Adding a flair filter is also easy to do. "
vc_wc,"if its weekly then you are saying people that are posting WTB ads need to make a new comment every week? How is that better?

Perhaps we are being a little selfish? 

How is the WTB post less valuable than a WTS post? You know you can search for ""[WTS]"" in the sub and the results will ignore any WTB post. 

I personally like to browse both. I have answered many WTB helping people connect as i may know someone has the watch they are looking for. 

Also, some say WTB posts are low effort - yet have you seen what people post WTS? no price, no images, etc. At least the WTB posts have a picture so i might even find a watch i didnt know about or might recognize one not by name or ref. "
vc_wc,"Posting my comment here as well:

Was there a need to solve a problem that didnt exist? It seems the benefit of the thread is much lower than the ability to post with your own info in a proper post. Posts are better searched, they ""live"" longer, and encourages discussion. 

Am I off base?"
vc_wc,"a lot less. and it is bad. A market requires both sides, WTB are as helpful as WTS posts. I still dont know what problem was being solved when this decision was made"
vc_wc,"Maybe i am missing something but how is it easy to search? 

If there are more than a couple of hundred comments you have to first expand before searching.

If the replies go too deep they are also not searchable. 

What if it was posted last week, or last month? 

I disagree 100% on the sticky. I think its clunky and useless. I have received leads for stuff i WTB because of old posts. This way those would be lost. Also not all sellers are as motivated to go to huge lengths."
vc_wc,"How did the consolidated WTB thread come about? 

I didnt see any community feedback (or request for feedback) and I didnt think it was an issue. 

Was there a need to solve a problem that didnt exist? It seems the benefit of the thread is much lower than the ability to post with your own info in a proper post. Posts are better searched, they ""live"" longer, and encourages discussion.

vc_wc,"If you are not a member of the bmw cca, you should. As a member, you have access to an onbudsman that can help you with stuff like this. 

Obviously it's not corporate, but they have helped similar cases in the past. At the very least they should be able to give you some guidance.

vc_wc,you saying you posted this less than 1 minute ago and its already sold? Your comment below has $3250 instead of $2250.
vc_wc,I have dealt with him a few times. I would work with him again
vc_wc,this is interesting - i have a 1990 and it has a very faint glow on the hands but not the dial or i havent noticed
vc_wc,"$50? you are not wrong but i didnt think the point of this place was to beat up other people. Its not like he is asking $500 over market. We are supposed to be dealing in good faith. I am sure that if you throw an offer for $50 less he is not going to bite your head off.

Unless you are implying that he is not reputable, which you have a right to do but I think its an unfair implication at least from my dealings with the OP.

I dont mind having a price discussion or a condition discussion, but we shouldnt go after reputation if its not warranted

vc_wc,"hey Blob, im new to this crypto game. But is there no shorts or puts?"
vc_wc,Price? Location? Payment method?
vc_wc,"Yeah that's strange. We might be better off posting the site he uses, since he forces people to pay him through that instead of paypal.

This way we can recognize him if he gets other alts. Should also post it in his feedback. "
vc_wc,Can you get that person to screenshot both pm (blurring his name)? Which by the way is a little too late cause the 2 mentioned here know who they pm'd.
vc_wc,"Where did you get...

Jk

Beautiful watch, even better seller.

Good luck with the sale!"
vc_wc,post pictures of the snowflake! where did you get it? And glwts!
vc_wc,"Looks super scammy. Should be removed from here. 

Unless the people behind her are transparent about it. 

The site itself has no info about it, no phone, no address. No affiliation to anything. "
vc_wc,If your friend wants to move it for a little over 2k I might be interested. 
vc_wc,That dial looks great! 
vc_wc,"$2200 for a presage model?! 

The dial is nice, not quite snowflake but looks interesting. What is driving the price?

"
vc_wc,"thanks for the tag, been working with OP on a trade for a while"
vc_wc,how did i miss this? LMAO. its not even a super cool unique rolex. Its probably an aftermarket dial (idk if it is or isnt but its something he would do)
vc_wc,"Thank you!

It's 3559.32. Schumacher 6th title limited edition. 1/6000"
vc_wc,"But if you are going to add lume, make it useful. Between 8 and 4 it will be bright like the sun, but between 4 and 8, gfy. Lol "
vc_wc,"It looks pretty sharp, makes me feel better about this [sudden purchase](https://i.imgur.com/9sxOLF9). Basically the reduced version. "
vc_wc,"Maybe, I'm yet to see a flattering picture. And as for the size, I think they are a little late to that. In general I think we will see regression in the years to come and cone down to 36-42mm ranges. 

But of course, for someone with a big wrist , it's needed. "
vc_wc,"If it was another brand it would have come across better. Like a Hamilton would have been praised. 

I don't like it from nomos, just such a aesthetic departure imo. The date window sucks so bad. The stupid lume, in some colors the hand is not lumed. So good luck guessing the time between 4 and 8 in a dark room or at night. 

I liked the idea and I love the car theme, but the execution was weak. Autodromo does much better from a design perspective.

And then you have the price - there is no reason for it. 

Really unfortunate because I like nomos. To me possibly the most disappointing release of the show so far.

Edit: to add a positive take. I like the sunk dial and sub dial. It gives cool depth."
vc_wc,"Unpopular opinion, I don't like it at all. It's got to be the most unreadable watch I have seen today.

The sub dial hands blend with the skeleton. Even the hour hand does. The bezel looks too thin.  

Omg and I just noticed the date. After looking at that picture 10 times and staring at it.  Yikes!

There is literally nothing I like about it. But that's probably just me and I'm about to get crucified. 

Edit: ok, I like the pushers. I think."
vc_wc,"The LV... i have spent the last 2 weeks chasing one because I was convinced they might discontinue, and the 11k price jumps to 15k in the gray market for BNIB and used would go to 12k easy. 

Hoping this softens that market a little bit. I have cleared out a bunch of my collection and im ready to get one once i find the right one. "
vc_wc,"but.... but this is exactly what happens. Now its all controlled by the ECU.

Look at Tesla, they put the same battery and control your range via software. You can even buy the upgrade from within the car in 5 minutes."
vc_wc,"This is awesome, the price is incredibly reasonable.

Not to hijack the thread, but why is there no sticky for Basel World 2018?"
vc_wc,/u/Nabsentia may have one for sale. 
vc_wc,hi. j/k - nice job here. i might have to start collecting Legos. Nice queue
vc_wc,That's not what my wife called it...
vc_wc,"Thanks! Found it through instagram, a shop in Turkey.

"
vc_wc,"My wife got me some Hirsch straps for Valentine's Day - one of them a black rally strap with red accents - though I didnt have any watches with any red accents (at that time) in the 20mm size she picked. 

By chance I happen to stumble upon this [LE Speedmaster](https://imgur.com/AANtVDT) on Tuesday - I had known of the different LE versions Omega had done for Schumacher, but I had not actually seen this specific one with the panda dial - and I just had to grab it. It was definitely an impulse buy - i didnt really do much research on the automatic movement but I have been meaning to try an auto speedy.

I think the rally strap fits the theme of the watch really well, and the red accent on the strap and dial go well together. 

Here is the back of the [Ref. 3559.32](https://imgur.com/Q4mE1wp).

vc_wc,"As the title says, im looking to acquire a Nomos Metro Datum Gangreserve - will consider a Tangente (maybe). PM me if you have one.

vc_wc,On the same boat. No luck so far.
vc_wc,"I got one that I'm probably going to withdraw cause I have been wearing it a lot, but here is another one at a better price: https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/comments/84ha00/wttwts_iwc_3706_and_nomos_orion_for_tudor_79180/"

vc_wc,"Nice piece! I too love the size.

vc_wc,"I was thinking strictly from buyer protection perspective. The same as f&amp;f. 

I wasn't thinking about it in the context of scammers abusing it. 

That's on me for not thinking it through. "
vc_wc,"Oh man, you were not kidding. You pulled the trigger really quick! Congrats on the new acquisition and glwts, it's a gorgeous watch!"
vc_wc,Thanks for the thorough response. I think something like this and other insights you and others have should be added to the wiki. 
vc_wc,"Not at all, it was definitely a situation where ignorance was bliss and I didn't want to recognize it. 

Unfortunately what this means, is that as an amateur seller, there is no safe way. You can do a lot of checking and research but a sophisticated scammer will get you. "
[deleted],[deleted]
vc_wc,"I'm wondering if I should decline venmo moving forward. But even someone paying via f&amp;f on paypal would be able to do the same. It's the exact same thing. 

I really thought f&amp;f was safe for sellers but I guess not really. "
vc_wc,"Would you agree that they also present a slightly more difficult path for a buyer to try to scam a seller?

I don't know if there are other ways but the way I know of, for f&amp;f payments, is for the buyer to file a dispute with their credit card/bank as if it was stolen/fraud. The bank in turn will flag all recent (and not so recent) paypal transactions (f&amp;f as well as g&amp;s) and force paypal to refund them all. This in effect puts the seller in a pickle, and a real scammer doesn't care, but it's also inconvenient to the buyer as other payments might be affected.

Obviously a scammer won't give a shit. But like I said it keeps mostly honest people honest. "
vc_wc,"Damn. I'm sorry to hear that. 

Watchnet has to be the sketchiest listing. I don't even bother clicking on any ad there. Anyone reputable would be cross posting in better forums like wus, trf, even tz. "
vc_wc,How did you get scammed via wire? You sent it and never received goods?
vc_wc,"There are ways, but is it fair to say that f&amp;f and venmo are equally good/bad for the seller?

There are ways but it will keep honest people honest; inline g&amp;s that has such a buyer protection, that just someone that is lazy and not that smart will try to screw you. 

With f&amp;f or venmo, the buyer srhould have to file a dispute and typically the bank will freeze not just that transaction but a lot others, which makes it more complicated for the buyer with more repercussions.

Maybe I'm over thinking it. I feel f&amp;f or venmo is way safer than g&amp;s. Maybe not as safe as a wire, but I don't know many buyers that would do that unless you have a million references; but we all have to start somewhere."
vc_wc,"That's what I figured but that's stupid. Someone could have just said something, like you did. Oh well."
vc_wc,"Yes, stamped manual, slide rule, and warranty card. "
vc_wc,"But I'm not asking the OP, I'm asking the guy that replied with the same experience"
vc_wc,"Thanks for sharing. I didn't realize you could do that through venmo, I actually thought it was safer than paypal. "
vc_wc,"Did you or /u/judorn check his venmo history? 

I only ask to see if that's a way to vet someone. You'd think a real user would have a lot of venmo transactions with real people. Right?"
vc_wc,"How much was the watch you were selling?

Edit:I don't understand the downvotes. I'm asking as I'm curious if the scammer was picking a specific price point"
vc_wc,Thanks man. Save my info and hit me up when you are ready. I'm in no rush to sell so it might still be around when you are ready to buy
vc_wc,PMd
vc_wc,Thanks for the tag!
vc_wc,"When you think about it, noswatches never behaved that way and he was basically ran out of town. 

I never sad that big of a problem with his posts but I understand why some did. This Tokyo guy is way worse though. "
vc_wc,"I didn't realize there was so much more drama with this fucking guy. Wow.

We all had a good read on this guy. Not only he should be banned but all his threads should be cross posted to his wus threads. "

vc_wc,"Damn. Decent price OP. 

I have been putting the $ together for a hulk (or Kermit as 2nd choice), but this is very tempting as this was also in the running. I'm in NYC too. "
vc_wc,"Wow holy shit OP. You got way more patience than I think I would. 

You offered a very fair price (not just compared to the dickheads asking for $2k), even considering you can order them now but have to wait. The $60 in difference is definitely worth the time.

And after that, you get a bunch of bs in your thread lol. That's why people come trying to gouge, cause they get the same amount of shit. 

Good for you OP, and shame on the others. True colors shown. I know whom I rather do business with. "
vc_wc,thanks for posting the whole convo. Paints a good picture
vc_wc,"you are still giving him too much credit given that other buyers are posting with similar experience, and basically the same MO. "
vc_wc,"Hindsight is 20/20 but you should submit feedback because it could have prevented someone else to go through the same experience. 

10% off a future purchase is a joke. And Ignoring PMs or refusing a return when you are just flipping watches is just a shitty practice.

ps. not blaming you at all. But people should always leave feedback."
vc_wc,"This is not that hard dude. You can blame the buyer all you want, but your first response was ""NO Returns"". 

A ""final decision""? As a buyer, I am not letting you give me the run around. You either take it back, or you dont. There is nothing to work out in this case.
You should have thought about the feedback and your reputation when you decided how to respond.

Your response even now is so childish that you are not doing yourself any favors. Negative feedback can be overcome by doing the right thing, but the fact this is your stance says more about how you might handle another issue - and thats what will really deter people from doing business with you.
"
vc_wc,"I may be wrong here but you annoyed you had it for jess than 24 hours. Very hard to do due diligence that way. 

The least you can do, given your quick flip would be to take it back. Look at what has happened because you tried to ""work it out"", and I don't think the buyer should have to go through the trouble of bringing it to a watchmaker or pay to fix it. I don't care what the price was.
You are trying to repair a reputation by giving stuff away, which is a terrible way of repairing your reputation. You might buy some likes but it does nothing long term.

You could have spent a lot less by posting for the shipping back and refunding the money. Taken it to your watchmaker (or your dealer) and having it fixed (or get your own money back).


You can argue the watch was as advertised but that's a terrible argument when you didn't go through the trouble of verifying its condition.

Your lack of knowledge on the condition of the watch is not an excuse."
vc_wc,"Look at his recent feedback, apparently we all had it right."
vc_wc,"&gt; If you‚Äôd like to know, I sold a watch that both he, and I, didn‚Äôt inspect to the best of our abilities.

Say that's true, it's on the seller for not having done due diligence. You had it in your possession, he didn't. You can't equate his ability to inspect with yours, when you had it in your possession. 

And the fact that is your response says everything about you as a seller. "
[deleted],[deleted]
vc_wc,"Sorry you had to deal with this man. 

Could have seen this coming from his posts and his attitude. I don't want to be a total dick, but it would be worth posting this experience in his wts thread as a warning to others. 

Because in the end, it's not about the watch, it's about his response to the issue and what his practices are.

I hope people check feedback before engaging in business. I do, but many don't. "
vc_wc,"I have a completely untrained eye. I clicked on your link before reading the comments and responses below.

The bezel immediately jumped at me in picture 1 with the dot so close to the 6. And then the dot near the 20 also looked bad.

So if I can tell the bezel is suspect, it's fair to say that that it should be reported. "
vc_wc,any interest in trades?
vc_wc,Fantastic watch. I was actually about to pick one up but your price is better. Is it a full set?
vc_wc,How so? And why?
vc_wc,PM'd
vc_wc,"It was not for real, he was just being a ""funny guy"" (dick) because I forgot to blur one image. "
vc_wc,"I won't tag him, but also worth mentioning that the watchmaker is a redditor. "

vc_wc,"
Its in the comment - $4250 (OBRO). I am reasonable so i'll consider reasonable offers."
vc_wc,"The date window is at 4:30 (between the 4 and 5 markers) and it personally drives me a little nuts. I prefer my date at 3, 6, or even 9. Thats just my preference. 

I believe the 4:30 date window is how it was on the original navitimer, and that is why its implemented this way here. But I could be wrong."
vc_wc,Good to know - i didnt realize that was happening.

vc_wc,its right in the comment - $2200 OBRO

thank you and good luck to you brother! 
"
vc_wc,"These are more feelers than solid WTS. Some, like this one, I am hoping to trade or sell; but others I am going to see what it might get and it would have to be a great deal as I am much more hesitant to get rid of them. 

Really I am hoping to only sell 2 pieces which should give me enough to buy a Hulk :)

In the end of this trading/selling push, i hope to pick up a Hulk, a GS Snowflake, and a Nomos Metro Datum Gangreserve. It may or may not happen, but I cant sink any more fresh cash into this hobby lol

I still wear all these pieces, though some more than the others and while I really like them; there are others that I would like to try. "
vc_wc,That is also a really good point. I should be tagging the seller. I wish those straps had been included. 
vc_wc,Thank you sir. I am going to give it a try. Do you have a good source to get a good deal on them?
vc_wc,"Not at all. And absolutely no offense taken. Complete oversight on my end as I totally forgot to change the description in my saved copy. Thanks again - making the change now. I was considering buying a 19mm strap - because maybe thats why it has not bonded with me; a better strap might make all the difference in the world.

I wouldnt be surprised if this one gets withdrawn once i do get a new strap for it. "

BRAND              |Breitling Navitimer World GMT Ref. A2432212
--:|:--  
**Price**          |$4250 (OBRO)
**Watch Condition**|This is a 46mm Breitling Navitimer that actually wears really well for its size. I cant explain it - yes its very large but when you wear it, although large, it doesnt look like a pizza pie. It wears closer to a 44mm, i might even say that feels smaller than the Panerai. This watch was an eye opener for me to the quality of Breitling dials - although it seems bland, the dial on this watch is just amazing. For as busy as the dial appears with all the complications and the slide rule bezel, it actually reads really well. The bracelet here is also very good, it starts at 24mm and it tapers down at the clasp; very comfortable.
**What's Included**|Watch, Bracelet, Bakelite box (really beat up, got it that way), manual and slide rule, and warranty card.
**Payment method**|PAYPAL
**Location** |NY, USA  
**Shipping Method**|Insured and Signature required
**Anything Else?**|Looking preferably to sell, open to even or trade up + cash from me.

**Watch Condition**|This is a very wearable 42mm Breitling Navitimer, it was produced to celebrate the 75th anniversary of AOPA and it was limited to 750 pieces. This watch is in fantastic shape, no blemishes on the crystal and even the caseback is mint - the OEM strap was worn only a handful of times. As impressed as i have been with the dial finishing on this one, I just cant get past the date position at 4:30. Its otherwise a great piece, the black dial looks dark blue or black depending on lighting, while the red accents give it some extra depth.

**Price**          |$4500 (negotiable for the right trade and open to reasonable cash offers)
**Watch Condition**|This is a 44mm Panerai Luminor Marina - I acquired it from a estate sale along with another (PAM51). I was never going to post this one, but there is a shiny object I want to get and though I could float the $ I am trying to be disciplined and sell one before buying the other one. It has been worn but not abused - i never exposed it to water and never dropped or hit. This is an H series, which dates it to 2005. This watch has an in-house automatic movement, the OP III - which I believe is based on the Valjoux 7750 and has a 42 hour reserve. You can see [the official specs here](http://www.panerai.com/en-us/collections/watch-collection/luminor/luminor-marina-automatic-acciaio---44mm_pam00104.html). It has the iconic dial with hour luminous markers, a small seconds subdial at 9 o'clock; and a date at 3 o'clock. The crystal is sapphire and it has a built-in cyclops that doesnt protude as some others. The case is stainless steel with the typical panerai crown protector. This one comes witht he OEM rubber in great condition and the OEM deployant. This does NOT have the panerai strap system, instead it has screws and are very easy to change.

**Watch Condition**|This is a 40mm Panerai Luminor Marina - I acquired it from a estate sale along with another. I have to make tough choices and I decided to keep the other. Some light scratches to the case (mostly in the back, see pictures) and very light scratches to the bezel (tried my best to picture them) typical of a watch its age. This is an H series, which dates it to 2005 - which had a very small production of just 500 units of this model. They stopped making this model in 2010 and its not very common to get a white dial in the 40mm size - most Panerai are in the 44mm range. This watch has an in-house automatic movement, the OP III - which I believe is based on the Valjoux 7750 and has a 42 hour reserve. It has a beautiful white dial with white hour luminous markers, a small seconds subdial at 9 o'clock; and a date at 3 o'clock. The crystal is sapphire and it has a built-in cyclops that doesnt protude as some others. The hands are white with full lume. The case is stainless steel with the typical panerai crown protector.

**Watch Condition**|This is a gorgeous dark (Urban Grey) dialed Nomos Metro 38 - This was originally sold by well known /u/ranxoren and I got it from his buyer who only had it for 1 month and needed the cash. This buyer got rid of the original 19mm strap and replaced it with the current 18mm leather strap. This is reflected in the price. I had been chasing a Nomos and while this is a fantastic watch, I really love the power reserve indicator and I need a date complication. I wore it 3 times - I love the watch itself but I just dont wear it - i think a white dial will fit better in my collection. So this watch is in great shape, has plenty warranty and comes with original box and papers.

vc_wc,"I have not seen an autavia. 

At first I was also thinking he had a bunch but after a few episodes, it seems he rotated just 2 or 3 and 2 of them were Breitling. 

Maybe I missed the autavia, it wouldn't surprise me if he had one or an ALS, but I don't remember seeing it. "
vc_wc,Thats a cool watch. Do you have a shot of the lume?
vc_wc,"are you open to adding cash? 

I was just finding something close in value. If you are open to adding cash on your end I got Breitling, Panerai, IWC, and Rolex"

vc_wc,I know the feeling. Nice pick up. Can't wait to see it later... ;)
vc_wc,You animal!
vc_wc,Right place right time
vc_wc,"As someone said last week. I would welcome enforcement of keeping the price after item is sold. 

I would even suggest that it should be included in the title. So it cannot be edited. 
If people want to reduce it, they should use a flair to indicate it. "
vc_wc,Would you mind putting back up the price? It's in the rules. 
vc_wc,lol. good to know. i'll drop it in passing just to see their reaction
vc_wc,"Lmao. I just saw this. Question, what kind of people you hang out with? Just so I can ask for wristys at will. "
vc_wc,"I REALLY like it but it just isnt getting much wrist time. Not necessarily about the size, it was actually more about the bracelet for me. As comfortable and solid as the bracelet is, it definitely made it heavier and chunkier. Great presence though, and would look amazing at the beach or in the water. In an office setting, not so much. 

ps. it is sold now"
vc_wc,"Hey sorry for the delayed response. 

I have not measured the lug to lug, and while it is large, 50mm sounds aggressive. The bracelet is definitely solid and makes it feel larger, but again, 58mm sounds very exaggerated. 

For reference, my wrist is not much larger than yours. It does wear large, but it's more related to height than length. "
vc_wc,"Thanks brother, it's a great watch!"
vc_wc,Thank you! this is the watch that made me pay attention to some german stuff.
vc_wc,"Send me a PM - i typically want a date complication but I'd be willing to discuss depending on condition, if its full set, and value. "
vc_wc,Thanks dude!
vc_wc,"I'll say that I have had several watches with the Valjoux 7750 - and I think you can cross it to the ""grade"" of the movement they use. I had some that are louder than others, and some that you feel the vibration and others that you dont. 
It may have to do with the watch itself, smaller ones might feel it more - rather than more solid/large ones like this one."
vc_wc,"hey thanks for the link. I will check it out - I try to stay away from EU/UK cause it can be challenging with the post office and customs. I'd do it for the right deal, but they also get fuzzy about the Euro and GBP exchange."
vc_wc,"If i had an exp i, not sure I would trade it. But I dont. If anything else interests you please do let me know."
vc_wc,Thanks man. I appreciate the support.
vc_wc,Its in the top comment - $4250 (OBRO)

**Price**          |$4250 (OBRO)
**Watch Condition**|This is a 46mm Breitling Navitimer that actually wears really well for its size. I cant explain it - yes its very large but when you wear it, although large, it doesnt look like a pizza pie. It wears closer to a 44mm, i might even say that feels smaller than the Panerai. This watch was an eye opener for me to the quality of Breitling dials - although it seems bland, the dial on this watch is just amazing. For as busy as the dial appears with all the complications and the slide rule bezel, it actually reads really well. The bracelet here is also very good, it starts at 24mm and it tapers down at the clasp; very comfortable.

vc_wc,None taken bud. Thanks for clarifying
vc_wc,"thanks man - its been on my radar for a while and after seeing one in person, it just reinforced the need to have one"
vc_wc,thanks brother - keep an eye out for me
vc_wc,I dont mind taking a little time to research it but yeah im going to check it out. I have used Rakuten before directly and even weibo and wechat in China for work. But had not thought of yahoo japan.
vc_wc,"and cheaper. I thought the same for the longest time, but recently the new one has grown on me with the more symmetrical dial."
vc_wc,i'll have to dig into it a little more. All the proxies seem very clunky
vc_wc,which proxy service do you use?
vc_wc,LOL is it? I was hoping it was starting to slow down
vc_wc,"those are good numbers if they are for a full set. Depending on condition. Takuya had a BNIB for $4500. 

Thanks for the pointer dude, i'll check it out"
vc_wc,"hey thanks man. well not all will go, but I figured I'd see what draws interesting offers. I also need to free up some cash to go after a couple of pieces"
vc_wc,"oh thats a good idea. I had not, though I was thinking rakuten could be a good place."
vc_wc,"Ha! yeah I decided to get a little more proactive about picking the spots I'd like to fill. 

I built my collection on an opportunity and whim basis, and I am pretty happy with it. And I still will do so cause its fun; but there are some pieces i'd like to experience and they wont fall on my lap.

This one, the nomos metro gangreserve, the kermit or hulk, a jlc mut, and a gmt master 2 are on the list.

I was just thinking about doing a sotc update cause there have been several changes since the last one and there might be a bunch of changes soon if all my trades here pan out."
vc_wc,Looking to trade for or buy a snowflake. Either the old or new version will be considered. 
vc_wc,"Thanks, yeah its a bit on the higher side - fair for a ""dealer"" price. Hoping for a private sale/trade."
vc_wc,"I'm a reasonable guy. If you are reasonable, then maybe there is a deal to be made. "
vc_wc,"Thanks bud, make me an offer?"
vc_wc,"Thanks man, now make me an offer :)"
vc_wc,"Not everything, I got 2 current targets and I'm trying to raise funds. I'm looking to pick up a kermit or hulk soon, so that's the main driver. I'm also looking for a jlc mut. Hoping that it brings the collection back to a manageable place. "
vc_wc,"I did, it is in the what's included section of my post. But I'll make it more obvious. I thought the other 2 straps were 18mm as well. Really unfortunate that he did that."
vc_wc,"Yes he did, which bummed me out. So it comes with just 1 xs strap. Also thank you for taking nice photos, I'm borrowing them :)"

**Price**          |$4000 OBO (negotiable for the right trade and open to reasonable cash offers)
**Watch Condition**|This is a 36mm Rolex DateJust Turn-O-Graph - Its an E series, dating it to about 1990. I got this from a fellow redditor - whom barely wore it and he acquired it from someone that also didnt wear it much after it had been serviced.  Though it looks like a regular DateJust from the era (36mm), it has a bi-directional engine-turned bezel. In this case the bezel is 18K white gold. This watch runs a ""modern"" Cal. 3130 and I just had it measured - its well within parameters.

vc_wc,"as much as can be expected on an overflowing collection that needs to be culled but i am terrible about letting go.

I actually took it as my one watch on a long weekend trip, it was great as it dressed up and down"
vc_wc,oh man. i hate you. want to take back the 3706 and give me this one instead?
vc_wc,I PM'd you with dibs
vc_wc,what is this?!
vc_wc,That fucking dial is stunning!
vc_wc,"Upvote for transparency. Out of curiosity, what did you trade in for it?"
vc_wc,"Edit: he won't be able to produce a timestamp since he is stealing the pictures from [this legit ebay item](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F142692746245) (credit to /u/EliRulez for link)

This guy... Posted it for $5500, got called out as an obvious scam. Deleted it and posted it for a higher price.

I don't know this guy but i would tread carefully. 

OP - if you have references, this is a good time to post them.

Also, check out the rules. You need a timestamp"
vc_wc,So this is unworn? What are you looking for trade?
[deleted],[deleted]
vc_wc,"Oh man, been looking for this. Got so excited until i saw the price. Lol"
vc_wc,Hnnnng that sandwich dial is so sexy
vc_wc,"I think flipping for a *reasonable* profit is fair.

The halios mark-up is BS, for a watch that is not even worthy of such hype/mark-up - as nice as the watch may be, it was priced right @ $600 originally. 

In this case, I think people are not as in tune with prices, so they upvote because its a nice watch. Those that have a pulse on this watch's market knew/know it is priced above market - you could argue it if the leather was omega original.

However this is not egregious, its right at what *I* think is fair - a full set in similar condition is around $3800 - and thats his in-person price, not unreasonable. 

It is great for him that he bought it at $3300 and buyer should consider that, only that someone may have a reason to dump it for such lower value. I am not accusing anyone because i dont know either seller, but when its too good to be true... and a flipper doesnt necessarily care as long as they can get their price"
vc_wc,i wasnt looking to buy one new - i was trying to gauge what premium you are charging for adding the leather strap plus deployant. It'd be good news to me as it would mean its appreciating considerably over time. 
vc_wc,"It's a gorgeous watch and good luck with the sale. I got one too.

I'm wondering how much is the leather strap and deployant worth?"
vc_wc,"benefit of the doubt only cause post history says you are just a dummy not a scammer. 

Yes its fake, not just fake, but its a shitty fake. I dont even know shit about AP and i can tell that its fake. 
"
vc_wc,"Where in Hawaii? We were in Maui and visited the AD there and they were offering pretty good discounts, also offered to honor the deal online afterwards so wet didn't have to pay tax. 

Their final pitch was to offer a lifetime value guarantee. You could come back and they would give you the same amount you paid for it if you were looking to upgrade later on. There were some conditions but it was a tempting deal. "
vc_wc,"&gt; ""The Luminor Due 3 Days Automatic Acciaio 38mm is $6,000 in stainless steel ""

I get they are trying to access a specific market, and also making sure that if a trend to smaller size is real, they are not left in the cold. 

I argue that the same style could have been done with a real in-house movement and water resistance. Yes, it would have been a taller case, but thats a brand style that people expect. "
vc_wc,"Nice watch OP.

Its *a* omega box, but is it *the original* box? Just clarifying. Is the warranty card named?

The aftermarket bracelet almost fooled me - if it wasnt for the clasp."
vc_wc,I agree. Leather and the original rubber strap. 
vc_wc,"lol im way over it. i dont even care. i am taking a dig for shits and giggles. i dont care that its smaller - and many people wont care about the water resistant. 

if anything i think it might work in my favor value-wise"
vc_wc,"I am not knocking them because of the size, I am knocking them because IMHO they are not following their own style and technical personality.

They include the signature crown guard for a watch that has basically no water resistant. It has a ""group movement"" instead of a real in-house, and I am personally not sure about the blue printed markers on the dial, and the strange lume color. But again its personal.

As always, if someone likes it they should get it."
vc_wc,"I wanted to share with you guys my Panerai Luminor Marina 40mm (PAM51), which I consider a ""real Panerai"" that happens to be smaller. If you follow the news, this is in contrast with the 38mm version just released at SIHH ([via Hodinkee](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/panerai-luminor-due-3-days-automatic-38mm-hands-on)). I'll let you figure out where you stand on your own but I know that a Panerai with virtually no water rating makes no sense. 


I had put this guy for sale/trade for a while, I just wasnt bonding with it - I loved the [white dial, the date with cyclops](https://i.imgur.com/rP16ReH.jpg), and still having the signature panerai style points besides it being a smaller size.  But there was something about it that just wasnt cutting it for me - and it was not until I put it on a leather strap that I realized it was the bracelet.  
Don't get me wrong, it is a great bracelet with a nice look - but it has too much contrast between polished and brushed areas, and its HEAVY... to the detriment of the watch. Once I removed the bracelet and put it on leather, the whole attitude of the watch changed - it became much more wearable to me, it went from being on the market to one of my most worn watches over the last few months. 


Once I saw the SIHH release, I realized that I blindly stumbled upon a very unique watch. Unlike the current 38mm and 42mm releases, I dont have to deal with a compromised version, without depth rating and styling decisions meant to reach to a new market (ladies). I dont know how long I will really keep this watch, because I already have other white dial watches and I have another Panerai - but for now I am really enjoying it - and it does give me joy when comparing it to this new release. Particularly because I personally think it falls way short, regardless of what Hodinkee or others say. (watch out for the downvotes!)

What do you guys think?
"
vc_wc,"Fair enough. A little traffic doesn't bother me. I just went for a drive and had a blast, the brp had some traffic but it was fun working around it and hitting some of those turns. 

I'll still say that I get to enjoy my drive at least once a day. 
"
vc_wc,"NYC area here. I find plenty of roads to enjoy. 

Even just now with a fair amount of rain, I just drove down and up the Bronx river parkway and it was a blast. Practiced some tough conditions driving speed limit in really narrow curvy road. 

You can hit a ton of back roads in Westchester county. Early AM is totally empty but even during the day.

Try the saw mill, the Bronx river, the hutch/Merritt and tell me they are not fun. 
And early morning is a 20 min drive from Manhattan or queens. "
vc_wc,"Nice watch and good luck with the sale. 

Surprised  /u/canadian_in_america didnt buy it from you - pretty sure he takes whatever nice watch crosses his path.
"
vc_wc,thats what I was wondering. Thats awesome
vc_wc,Hey what's the reference number? And what kind of movement does it have?
vc_wc,"Lol I had the same thought. 

Tbf I'm so uninterested in buying a full price Rolex I don't even know what the msrps are. "
vc_wc,So this is where you all are nowadays...
vc_wc,The answer is reserve de marche. I have been trying to get my hands on one for a while. 
vc_wc,"not sure how i feel about having all 3 of my numbers on the same column. on the one hand, its a good number for the pats. on the other, pats are going to have to score 40 or 50 to win"
vc_wc,Wth give me 2 more random
vc_wc,Give me 1 spot
vc_wc,Great job on the alpinist strap OP. Your asking price makes more sense with it. Good luck with the sale
vc_wc,"He is free to ask whatever he wants, maybe he is willing let it sit. Maybe there is a difference in condition, strap, extras. "
vc_wc,They used to be harder to get so they are holding at around $350 for a while. Now they are showing up here and other places almost every day. Prices have dropped. At $299 yours would go in less than an hour. 
vc_wc,"i know nothing about legos and i dont have any, but even I am confused why this is not filling. "
vc_wc,can we raffle individual pieces? 
vc_wc,Very nice. This one is on my list. Might pull the trigger soon if i can sell some of the stuff in my collection. 
vc_wc,"I dont have it my possession anymore but i think it was just the angle. try this picture: https://i.imgur.com/e1kCd3H
"
vc_wc,i'll take #19
vc_wc,ugh. sucks man. its a nice watch. I am particular to the red or i would give this a serious look and pick up in person next time im in the area. 
vc_wc,"&gt; VT, more than happy to meet in person within 30 miles of exit 10.

So burlington to randolph?

nice watch, how did you get that ding? 

glwts!"
vc_wc,"fair enough - it didnt come across. ""these steinhart guys"" sounded very pretentious; even to someone that is NOT a steinhart guy. 

wont beat this dead horse anymore - you and I know its a homage. most people dont. Its not an obvious reference to an old rolex. if you dont want to look like every other affordable diver copying rolex, this is a good option. thats all. "
vc_wc,"This is a really good point actually. 

I think the difference with the paul newman daytona is that its more well known and recognized; so anything that looks like it will be seen as a homage to it. 

Not many people would see this sub and know that its a rolex look-alike. But many will see a chrono with the same color and layout and think/know its a faux rolex."
vc_wc,"Not denying that at all. Its not just accepted, its well documented. I think either hodinkee or a blog to watch had an article about it. 

The point is not to deny that it is a homage, but that it is unlikely to be viewed as such by the masses because it doesnt have the ""modern"" signatures of a rolex sub. "
vc_wc,"I agree with you that Steinhart has been putting out rolex clones left and right, and I hate that as well. My whole comment here was that this is the ""least rolex copy"" of what they put out and what others doing divers put out (with Squale doing a really nice job on some of them).

I also agree that they lack creativity and are lazy; but this specific model is not going to be recognized as a homage for 99% of the population. So if im going to have an affordable diver and I dont want to have an easily recognized rolex wannabe, this is a very good option. Even though, for the elitist few its a blatant homage to a really rare never made again, military sub version."
vc_wc,if you do want it. PM me tonight and I can have it in the mail tomorrow!
vc_wc,"Its this one: https://i.imgur.com/qDQvm97.jpg

"
vc_wc,I have a fossil speed something. Don't even know what's wrong with it
vc_wc,"I didn't know there was a race either but apparently the hate for Steinhart is pretty strong? I don't know.

If the argument is that it's still pretending to be a Rolex, then sure. But it's a Rolex that you will likely never see in the wild compared to the more common, iconic, often-copied sub. "
vc_wc,"What if i prefaced my comment with ""IMHO"", would that have satisfied your sensibilities?

What my comment really was driving at, is that if you were to wear that in a room of 100 people, even if they were all /r/watches folks, only a small percentage would say ""oh hey that's a cool homage at a super rare vintage Rolex"".

So yes, to the majority of people, they won't relate it to a sub homage. I'm not denying it is, but that it's advantage is that it doesn't look like every other affordable brand diver.

I'm not particularly defending the brand here, they are guilty of making some bad homages as well. Just my opinion."
vc_wc,"Lol. What a pretentious comment. 

I'm hardly a Steinhart guy, just like I'm not a particular brand guy but I certainly don't need to put any brand down, and definitely not people that may like a brand.

But in any case, nobody is denying that it is a homage to a very rare and very hard to get/see/buy watch. 

Edit: removed name calling because I don't know you."
vc_wc,Would you consider trades?
vc_wc,"It is - good call - but i am referring to the more common homage to the modern sub.

The mil-sub is so uncommon (the last one i know of was estimated to go for 100-200k at auction in October but ended up getting pulled) and most people dont know it even existed that its hard to relate it as a homage. "
vc_wc,Breitling Navitimer World GMT: https://imgur.com/a/fIInm
vc_wc,"Today I wanted to share one of the first watches that left my collection that I still think about. I got this Steinhart watch from another reditor and was very impressed by the craftmaship. The beveled crystal was a nice touch and although the lume (faux-vintage) can be controversial I liked that it gave it a particular warmth to the dial. And as you may know already, this is the original OVM with the ""real"" black dial that is even more sought after nowadays. 

One big reason I liked this watch so much was because unlike other more affordable divers, it didnt have the need to be a ""homage"" or replica of a sub. Most others in this price range and quality tendo to use the same hands, markers, and bezel style - making most of them closer to a faux-sub rather than an honest homage with their own spin. I found this diver to have its own character, with very solid build quality, and enough detail to make it worth of wearing. 

I ended up having to let this one go and wish i hadnt - it would be the perfect go-to diver for anyone that beats up on their watches or a great option to wear around when I dont want to risk other pieces. "

Also, it's very gratifying to save your way into building your collection. Although this was acquired in the span of a year (a few months really), the saving and the leading up was for a few years. I just didn't rush into it, until now.

You should know and consider that I also built this collection being opportunistic. I don't have every watch i want, and most of them are not that ones i sought out from the beginning. But I went in with an open mind and a higher tolerance for risk. As a result I have been pleasantly impressed and surprised by most. 

Thank you again and hope to see your sotc soon!"

I do want to some day fill a watch box with the classics: speedy pro, sub, etc but for now I just want to pick up watches that draw my eye or have cool interesting history, or some great technical accomplishments.

vc_wc,"Well, to be fair I picked up the first 2 about 2-3 years ago. Always had the intention to build a collection as I always loved watches but I was 100% ignorant. 

That ignorance prevented me from jumping in. In the last year i learned a lot and jumped both feet in trying to figure out what I like and dont, the quality and value propositions, and the technical innovations and differences. Just SO MUCH TO LEARN! 

So yeah, this has been the first year of truly collecting, flipping watches in and out. It did escalate quickly and I am trying to slow down but its impossible. I have 1 guaranteed incoming, but I have 3 or 4 in the pipeline that may come in the next month."
vc_wc,haha yeah - I am not the most sentimental person but I still care a lot about that watch. I am going to hand it down to my kid eventually to beat up the same way I did. 
vc_wc,"
Alright I figured this would be a good time to jump in. **[Here is my collection](https://imgur.com/a/GfQ95)** as of this morning. Not a real theme to it other than learning and picking up stuff i liked and then figuring out stuff I didnt like. 

###Current Collection

In order of acquisition:

* **[Unknown japanese quartz](https://imgur.com/vC0fifp):** I found this one in an old box - its my first memory of a watch and i must have been 6-8 years old when it was given to me by my parents. I cant believe that this watch made it after moving continents over 20 years ago and then moving several times with me. In any case, I found it and decided to put a new battery on it and boom, it runs. It is running a little slow, about 1 minute a month. I havent had time but I will try to learn more about it.

* **[Omega Speedmaster Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/KpnhJns):** 18k white gold bezel, gorgeous cream dial and stunning blue broad arrow hands. Add a moonphase complication and a quick date and moon set and this is could easily be a collection of 1. I acquired this one, and the one below, a couple of years ago at the same time. I had told myself that I would reward myself with a *nice* watch when i reached a professional milestone. When I did, it took me a year to figure out what to get - and when I finally did, i still couldnt make up my mind, which brings me to the next one.

* **[Omega Speedmaster Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/PT43CrZ):** See above. This reference has the traditional speedy bezel and traditional hands, but i love the detail of the gold color rings around the subdials. It gives a little extra depth to the dial. These 2 moonphase references are so nice that I had to get them both. 

* **[Rolex DateJust Turn-O-Graph ""Thunderbird""](https://imgur.com/qjFdRYF):** Got this from /u/want_bourbon - my first Rolex. I just love the dial on this one - it has such a great reaction to light and different angles, its really stunning. The bidirectional bezel is 18k white gold and the reference has a pretty cool history behind it. It has played the role of the ""dress"" watch in the collection for a while. 

* **[Panerai Luminor Marina](https://imgur.com/cWze8eh):** I had been lusting over a Panerai for a long time but I always had a hard time understanding the fanatic following. I love the look and thought it would be too big. But since i got this watch it has been one of, if not the, most worn watch in the collection - its just so damn comfortable. It has the right weight and presence and I have hard time thinking I would let this one go unless it was an upgrade in complications or power reserve. 

* **[Panerai Luminor Marina](https://imgur.com/rP16ReH):** This is another one where I couldnt make up my mind and bought a black and white dialed version. This is a smaller 40mm (rare for Panerai) and it has a bright white dial with small seconds and pretty great lume. Having the date and cyclops is a bonus and IMO its cool that it is a flat cyclops in the crystal unlike others that protrude. 

* **[Omega Seamaster Pro Chrono](https://imgur.com/KS1GgM3):** I had been looking for a regular seamaster in different versions but I always felt that the market was flooded with it in all kinds of conditions but rarely mint - and the prices all over the map. This one sort of fell on my lap and I had to pick it up. Bonus on the condition of the lume plots and the bezel - both in fantastic shape. 

* **[Breitling Navitimer World](https://imgur.com/KCsHcVQ):** Got this from /u/RugbyGuy0989. I had my doubts on this 46mm dinner plate - and some might say its too big for my wrist, but i really dont care. This thing is pretty awesome. The quality of the finish and detail on the dial is amazing - I was pleasantly surprised by it and brought Breitling up a notch or 2 in my book. Although a super loaded dial with complications, it actually reads pretty easily and looks fairly subdued.

* **[Glashutte Original Vintage](https://imgur.com/YlXlEfR):** Got this one from /u/WhiskeyMan4. I dont know much about it and trying to learn more - I am pretty sure this is considered a ""senator"" and it is stamped with the GUB marks from the time when Germany was dealing with post war effects. This checked several boxes: vintage, dress, german. Its a very cool watch with a gorgeous dial, and my favorite part are the hour markers. This is the inspiration for the new GO ""sixties"" release.

* **[IWC Flieger Chrono](https://imgur.com/yk09Dcs):** This is the latest addition - just got it from /u/canadian_in_america via trade. Only had it for 1 night so i am still learning about it and feeling it out. I can tell you that it wear true to its 39mm size and fits so nicely. I really like the day-date complication (my first) and the clarity of the hands. 


###Gone

These were sacrificed along the way - in order of departure - most recently first:

* **[Rolex Air King](https://imgur.com/dDNF1FH)**

* **[Steinhart OVM 1.0](https://imgur.com/3j0YvjL)**

* **[Hamilton Jazzmaster Chrono](https://imgur.com/vquS48R)**


###Never Made It

These never made it into the collection for one reason or another:

* **[Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra](https://imgur.com/qWeA4TY)**

* **[Oris Big Crown](https://imgur.com/z6Vk1d5)**

* **[Oris Artix Chronograph](https://imgur.com/VRbGMEA)**

* **[Oris Artix Grande Lune Complication](https://imgur.com/0NCmyAH)**


###Incoming

This one should be here early next week - it got delayed by customs:

BRAND              |Panerai Luminor Marina PAM00051  
--:|:--  
**Price**          |$4500 (negotiable for trade)
**Watch Condition**|This is a 40mm Panerai Luminor Marina - I acquired it from a estate sale along with another. I have to make tough choices and I decided to keep the other. Some light scratches to the case (mostly in the back, see pictures) and very light scratches to the bezel (tried my best to picture them) typical of a watch its age. This is an H series, which dates it to 2005 - which had a very small production of just 500 units of this model. They stopped making this model in 2010 and its not very common to get a white dial in the 40mm size - most Panerai are in the 44mm range. This watch has an in-house automatic movement, the OP III - which I believe is based on the Valjoux 7750 and has a 42 hour reserve. It has a beautiful white dial with white hour luminous markers, a small seconds subdial at 9 o'clock; and a date at 3 o'clock. The crystal is sapphire and it has a built-in cyclops that doesnt protude as some others. The hands are white with full lume. The case is stainless steel with the typical panerai crown protector. The bracelet is also steel and it is very comfortable. This does NOT have the panerai strap system, instead it has screws and are very easy to change; the bracelet itself is also very easy to resize as the links also use screws.
**What's Included**|Watch, bracelet, a couple of extra links, and rubber crystal/case protector in a generic box - no B&amp;P
**Payment method**|PAYPAL
**Location** |NY, USA  
**Shipping Method**|Insured and Signature required
**Anything Else?**|Looking preferably to trade - open to cash either way but dont want to go too far down market, though I would consider trade for multiples. Up market I will consider almost anything.

vc_wc,PM's
vc_wc,"I appreciate you coming back and apologizing. Apology accepted and yeah a PM is probably better next time - however I think if you get a brush off response, then maybe it should be made public because clearly trying to hide something. 

first you make me see the gap, and then you send me on a wild goose chase to figure out if i should be worried.

On my limited search the spacing is a feature not a bug - its definitely not a tell as there are plenty of genuine dials with the same gap. But now I am paranoid so I am researching it further."
vc_wc,"Hmmm. no i think its fair, just think we should not throw it around so easily. 

This is probably the thread you are referring to: https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/3o0j8l/panerai_how_to_spot_a_fakeany_surefire_methods/

I have only seen one other post but it refers to the same reply. 

I did find this from Tourneau: https://www.tourneau.com/watches/pre-owned-panerai/luminor-marina-stainless-steel-automatic-pam00051-VPN9700098.html - it has the same spacing.

And tourneau is an AD: http://www.panerai.com/en/network/authorised-dealers/detail.US.html#top

So I would hope they would notice if they are putting a replica dial or worse selling a replica. "
vc_wc,"dude thats kind of fucked up - you shouldnt throw that around unless you are fairly certain, not something you read online. Can you at least point me in the direction of what you read?

In any case - since you mentioned it I went looking to see if I just never noticed and apparently i never did. I have found a lot of images through chrono24 and they all have it. 

I looked on the panerai site but they dont have this model any longer and some of the new versions with the white dial have a similar if not exactly the same spacing."
vc_wc,PM'd
vc_wc,you are not sorry. not even a little bit. Now you must buy it or trade me something of value
vc_wc,dude. WTF. Why?!?! Now I cant unsee it....
vc_wc,"Just looking from the outside here. I'd hate to see what kind of review you leave on yelp when a bartender decides to serve someone (a regular) ahead of you. yikes! - and by the way, thats a much better analogy than your silly mcdonalds analogy. He wasnt closed at all - someone came into the shop and bought the last item - your choice would have been to wait until the item is available again or order something else form the menu. But you would probably write a bad yelp review how mcdonalds sold the last mcmuffin to someone else.

And for the record, no I do not understand your frustration. Seller doesnt owe you anything, doesnt even owe you a reply. That may or may not be good business practice but its his right, and its certainly not a reason to post a bad review about a transaction that didnt happen.

You really dont look great on this dude. He could have said, ""because I liked his hair better"" and it would be just as valid. My watch my rules? Certainly his behavior would not stop me from trying to buy a watch from him and I would try several times even if i kept missing.

vc_wc,"Look at Pic 3 and Pic 4 - is that what you mean by hallmarks?

Also, I guess I considered aftermarket as a genuine but non-original part. So it might be a real rolex president bracelet, but no the original to the watch?
"
vc_wc,"Hi /r/rolex - There are not enough Turn-O-Graphs in this sub so here is my [Rolex DateJust Turn-O-Graph](https://i.imgur.com/TxLpkDJ.jpg?1). 

Its an E series, dating it to about 1990. I got this from a fellow redditor - whom barely wore it and he acquired it from someone that also didnt wear it much after it had been serviced. 

I just had it measured a couple of months ago - its well within [parameters](https://i.imgur.com/efF1vf5.jpg?1).

I have been wearing it in a rotation and I typically pick it out more often when its a more formal occasion. It gets a fair amount of wrist time though not as much lately since the collection is growing; but i find it very versatile. I am trying to figure out what other strap I could use to dress it down a little more without looking odd. I tried a black alligator strap and it was ok but not that awesome; I am open to suggestions.

Edit: I thought I had added this when I posted but must have not sent submit."
vc_wc,"Good question, and none that i can see. Seller admits, it's an after market president bracelet"
vc_wc,"Perhaps. Jazzmaster new from an AD is in the $1k range. Used is in the $650 range depending on condition. 

My biggest issue with the bracelet was not the bracelet itself but the case and lugs design. "
vc_wc,"yeah but its the inconvenience - the watch may be safe but I still have to deal with it.

Perlon is probably too thick as well. 

The bracelet is, like the rest of the watch, meh. It was comfortable enough and had good heft; but it was a scratch magnet. "
vc_wc,"Correct, I didnt have the 2nd set of holes. I could have squeezed a NATO (and i used a really thin one), or as you said, do the spring bars. But then, there would be all this pressure on the spring bar; eventually failing on me. 

The gap with the leather wasnt terrible but it was noticeable and it really bothered me. Here is a [shot](https://i.imgur.com/Z21xM9w)

"
vc_wc,"Ok - so on the low end I see these going for $5500 no B&amp;P and some with pretty faded bezels. I can pick this up for around $4,000.
I'll see if i can get a picture of the crown screwed down. 

On the second one, I do have a worn out potential serial number from the seller if that helps. Let me know and I can PM you. I agree with you on the dial, and i dont see any reference to a morellis dial - it may be considered a ""bark"" dial or not really? Probably a custom dial. 
"
vc_wc,"No, this one had a single set. I was annoyed that you couldnt fit a NATO strap - there was not enough distance between the spring bar and the case, although the lugs are really long. 

I tried putting it on leather, but then there was an ugly gap. Just a really strange design. "
vc_wc,"Oh I actually like the wording - there is really no other place on a crowded dial. 

I think my favorite part maybe the gold colored ring around the subdials."
vc_wc,"Thanks for taking the time to look.

on the first one, lets say that I cant get a picture and the deal is as is. What is my risk, in $? crown replacement? what are your thoughts on the condition?

For the second one - thanks for the info. I figured the finish was factory and on purpose but didnt know what it was called. I think its kinda cool. Anything that you would consider a 2nd look?
"

vc_wc,"Yeah Moon-y was lame. Sue me.

I shared in the past its close sibling the [white-dial broad-arrow white-gold speedy moonphase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/712vpf/omega_speedy_pro_moonphase/), and figured today would be a good day to share the black-dialed moonphase.

This is a sapphire crystal with the traditional speedy pro hands and bezel. The caseback is also sapphire and you can see the gorgeous movement through it. 

Back when I decided that I needed a speedy pro and was searching for the right watch to buy - originally I was searching for a birth year or for a special year - one of many life events I wanted to celebrate. In any case, I couldnt find the right one in the right condition when one day I came across the other sibling of these 2, the [ref. 3575.30](https://shop.r10s.jp/yamaki78/cabinet/img59533680.jpg) which is a silver dial and white gold bezel as well as white gold markers speedy pro. 

When I saw the moonphase, I knew i needed to have one with it - but I was not sold on the allwhite/silver look. It felt like a whiteout and after handling one, I thought it had too much of a reflection and made it hard to read. Thats when I found the [Ref 3575.20](https://i.imgur.com/Wwvt86f.jpg) and fell in love with the blue hands and markers.

As I was researching the caliber and details, I came across the [Ref 3576.50](https://imgur.com/txonkfQ) we got here - and had a huge dilemma - which one to get?!

""Lucky"" enough, a respected member/seller of the omega forums had both available and he was local. I had to go see it, he was awesome and let me handle both. The 2 he had were manufactured in key years in my life. He then also made an offer I couldnt refuse. Both came with box and papers and just serviced. I had to have both.

TL;DR: I walked away with twin black/white dialed speedy pro moonphase watches
"
vc_wc,"You are mostly right i guess. 

I'll have to see what other movements they use in other models. 

I didn't include this but the bracelet was not a highlight either, and changing straps on this one was a painful process.  

"
vc_wc,"Changing it up a little, we all talk about the watches we currently have and those we like and lust after; but we dont talk much about those we do not like. At the risk of getting downvoted to hell here I'd like to hear other's thoughts on this watch. This was the first watch that I let go because it was getting no wrist time and I had no desire to wear.

I had always liked the idea of a Hamilton, read the history, and thought that many of their models looked good. But had not had a chance to spend significant time with them. I should have stuck to my original attraction to the pilot and field type watches Hamilton makes; but I didnt and this is what happened.

I acquired this watch from another redditor, lets say it fell on my lap. This is Ref. H326160 (one version prior to the current one). As soon as I received it, my first thought was that I liked the heft and weight of it. I read up on the movement (Valjoux 7750) and was impressed by the reports of its reliability and workhorse-like fame. 

Thats what I would call the highlights - from there I started nitpicking the details. Over time I thought the dial felt busier than it really was, and I think it has to do with the lack of symmetry more than the number of complications. I felt the seconds subdial at 9 was out of place lacking the silver ring the other 2 subdials sport. The date window at the 4 position was fine, but seemed inconsistent with the subdial at 9 that still has a marker while the date didnt. Finally, the applied dials looked fine but the lume was certainly lacking while the hands did not look as sharp as they could be IMO. 

Finally, the chrono pushers lacked feel when pushed, its almost like it had to much give and the button had to travel too far to finally click. Perhaps I am just used to the Omega chrono but it just felt not as refined. 

So now, those that have had this watch, or really love Hamilton - tell me why I should give it another try?"

vc_wc,"Maybe, I am actually short on divers - send me a link to the pictures? whats the condition?"
vc_wc,"See the detailed information below. At this point I am looking for cool trades or to just sell it outright. For trades I am open to anything thats interesting - I am open to cash going either way with almost no limit so feel free to bounce any ideas.

Here I have a BNIB/NOS Oris watch. Stainless steel everything (case, bezel, and bracelet) with a silver dial and arabic numerals at 3, 6, 9, and 12. It has 13 diamond hour markers (2 above the 12) above the stick hour marks. This watch has a 38mm diameter and the Oris 733 movement (based on Sellita SW200-1).

I acquired this from a estate sale, its never been worn but it does not have the manual or papers, just the box, pillow and watch.

vc_wc,"That's a gorgeous watch. Nice job finding one. 

These are really hard to find, particularly as a full set and in that condition. "
vc_wc,Damn. At that price it's a killer deal. Even with grey market warranty (or lack thereof)
vc_wc,"Lol I'm trying to figure out why the downvotes... People must have not heard of gap insurance. Or maybe they don't understand all-time low rates. Oh well

Glad you are keeping the omega. Good luck with the sale. "
vc_wc,"If it's true that you only wore it once and there are otherwise literally no marks on it, then it's a very unique situation. Unfortunate for you as said above for $90, you get a brand new one.

I'm curious why wearing it once forbids you from returning it. I don't know the return policy so honest question.

I'd think $1000-1100 is more likely to sell. Even then you may be better off keeping it and wearing it. "
vc_wc,"I just got a breitling navitimer world and love the design and functions. Even though it wears small for a 46mm, I have been wondering if anyone was producing the same or similar design in other sizes.

Can you tell me what size this is and what movement it uses? "
vc_wc,"Putting a down payment is not necessarily a good financial decision. Just saying. 

Sorry you have to sell them, nice watches. Good luck!"
vc_wc,It's $1290 new. I assume it includes paypal fees and shipping and insurance?
vc_wc,It really looks great. I adjusted the clasp but there are no micro adjustments which might be a problem. 
vc_wc,Trying on the latest addition: [Panerai PAM 104](https://imgur.com/ed9IOcp)
vc_wc,"How recent was the service, by whom, and do you have service paperwork? Does the service have a warranty?"
vc_wc,"It's 46mm. For reference, my wrist is about 6.5"".

And thanks! It wears really well for its size. "
vc_wc,Rule #1 - we don't talk about it. But yes. 
vc_wc,"That's fair and thanks for adding the info. 

Just a heads up there is an identical watch posted just now with full box and papers for $100 less. 

If you need to get rid of it quickly you might need to come down a bit. 

Good luck with the sale"
vc_wc,Nice dude. It's pretty clean. How much time left on the warranty?
vc_wc,"Dude, that is so nice. "
vc_wc,"Latest addition. 

[Breitling Navitimer World](https://imgur.com/nShEkkA)

Just resized and testing fit now. "
vc_wc,"Nice watch. 

Some of the pictures show a small mark on the bezel around the 10. It's pretty clear on a couple of pictures. And hard to see in others.

Is it just a lighting artifact?"
vc_wc,Very nice. Bought it originally?
vc_wc,That sounds like a fair price as long as it looks done right. Its strange to me that they used ink that wears off pretty easily. 
vc_wc,"Dude thats a really nice one - I like how the blue dial contrasts the gold bezel. What year is yours? Looks really clean and all original!

How is your lume? Its surprisingly still glowing on mine."
vc_wc,dude thats awesome. Thanks for sending me down a rabbit hole. I like that white dial with the green accents.
vc_wc,"I didnt know it was all-red. Thats even better!
"
vc_wc,"Oh wow. I did not know that the TOG had a full red wheel. That must be only on the newer 116264 series. 

I have not seen that green one - whats the dial color? white or black? if black then it would be like the milgauss, but cooler"
vc_wc,Nice. I like the white dial with the roulette day and the red turn-o-graph script. 
vc_wc,"Hello /r/watches - here is my new-to-me [Rolex DateJust Turn-O-Graph](https://i.imgur.com/TxLpkDJ.jpg?1). Its an E series, dating it to about 1990. I got this from a fellow redditor - whom barely wore it and he acquired it from someone that also didnt wear it much after it had been serviced. 


For some reason you don't see many of these around and they dont get too much love - though I think its pretty cool because it is a unique series. Though it looks like a regular DateJust from the era (36mm), it has a bi-directional engine-turned bezel. In this case the bezel is 18K white gold - and unfortunately it is a scratch magnet. This watch runs a ""modern"" Cal. 3130 and I just had it measured - its well within [parameters](https://i.imgur.com/efF1vf5.jpg?1).


I have been wearing it in a rotation and I typically pick it out more often when its a more formal occasion. It does get its fair amount of wrist time as I also wear it when dressed in casual clothes, it is actually very versatile IMO. I enjoy looking at it in different lights and it always draws my eye when driving. The [blue sunburst dial](https://i.imgur.com/UllimCt.jpg?1) is just stunning and really hard to capture in pictures.  


Some fun facts about this series:

* First series to have a rotating bezel (1953) 
* It was also the first ""tool"" watch 
* The USAF Thunderbird squadron adopted these watches in the 50s - Rolex then started naming them the ""Thunderbird"" in marketing materials. 


Unfortunately this series was discontinued in 2011, and I dont really blame them as the most recent version looked weay too much like a regular datejust with a fluted numbered bezel instead of an engine-turned bezel. However I wouldnt be surprised to see this come back in the future as a limited edition. I also think that in time, these may be fairly sought after as there are less and less available.


What do you guys think?

Edit: Added a few more pics with direct sunlight."
vc_wc,"I don't see a verification picture. Also, picture of the extra straps?"
vc_wc,"Great seller, buy with confidence. 

Selfishly i say don't buy it so I have a shot at it but I'm not there yet."
vc_wc,"What was wrong with the 3575.20? And what was a good deal before you knew what was wrong?
"
vc_wc,Out of curiosity can you share more pictures? Also update if/when it detaches?
vc_wc,"It becomes habit. I wind my manual watch every morning, even if im not wearing it that day. "
vc_wc,"Today I am wearing the latest addition for the first time: [Steinhart OVM 1.0](https://imgur.com/6XIYOm6)

I am pleasantly impressed by the quality of this timepiece so far. "
vc_wc,Thanks dude!
vc_wc,Thank you!
vc_wc,"Well, the original bezel finish is more of a satin finish. I have noticed a few that have been slightly over polished to a shine; which changes the character a little.

I think before buying this watch, it needs to be seen in person on many different lights. And while thats true for all watches, it is really important for this one. I looked at [ref 3575.30](https://imgur.com/XgBfNbp) at the same time, and the blue indices have much better character under different lightning than the white gold markers in the [3575.30](https://imgur.com/r3ByUpR) which has more of a whiteout reflection under lighting.

Also, thank you. It is actually challenging to photograph accurately - not just the markers and hands, but the dial is a really great off-white; not quite cream, but not white. White it doesnt have a texture itself, the way the subdials are set with no bezel gives it a nice texture."
vc_wc,"/u/Sputniki Same wrist, for reference: https://imgur.com/b0iN5rp

This one is a sapphire sandwich, with a clear case back. Pretty sweet."
vc_wc,Thanks! Its actually a really versatile watch. It can pull off different textures and colors. 
vc_wc,Checking in as well: https://imgur.com/Wwvt86f
vc_wc,Nice catch moonbro - i only had time to wind it this morning. I set the date and moonphase once i got to the office: https://imgur.com/Wwvt86f
vc_wc,"For my first Speedy Tuesday post, here is my Speedy Pro Moonphase (Ref. 3575.20). 

It has the 18k white gold bezel with an engraved tachymeter (instead of an insert), including broad arrow blued hands and applied blue index markers on a creamy white dial. The blued hands, but particularly the index markers have great color variation depending on the light. Mostly unnoticed is the fact that the index markers do have small lume at the outer edge.

Thats just part of whats so cool about this reference - it can also be hard to find in good condition as it was a very short production run."
vc_wc,[Speedy Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/90VTEjN) looking particularly sharp on the drive to the office
vc_wc,"That was just an example, they should consider valjoux movements as well. 

I personally consider some of the ETA movements to be better/sturdier/more reliable than the miyota.

This may not be 100% true, but my perception. "
vc_wc,This and also don't forget to shame the seller here as well so we can avoid it in the future. 
vc_wc,"What I mean by that is i wish they would try to get other movements into their designs. As far as I know, they only use miyota movements; and I'd like to see them use ETA for example. "
vc_wc,Check with the folks at /r/rolex and they will tell you right away. 
vc_wc,What was the value she was looking to hear? 
vc_wc,As i told you before. when you want to get rid of it (or raffle it) you let me know. I wish i had gotten it. 
vc_wc,I just love their designs. I need to get one soon. But I only wish they sourced other movements. 
vc_wc,thats sweet. i havent seen anything on CL beyond spammers and scammers. you found this in the LA CL? 
vc_wc,Story time? Pictures?
vc_wc,Never heard of it. Can you show us some pictures of the watches you have received?
vc_wc,Thanks for sharing and taking one for the team. Glad I didn't try it. 
vc_wc,Do you mind telling us what you got each time?
vc_wc,"I like that its a proper swiss made watch with great history and quality. I think its an honest homage, but wish they would not use the mercedez hands - that ruins it for me because instead of a homage it comes across like a replica. Their 1545 MilSub is probably the nicest one of all. "
vc_wc,"There is such a thing as you much if a good thing.

The power reserve it's kind of cool, but that subdial ruins the watch for me.

Also, three original dial with silver hands still the best looking one. Definitely should recommend the older version."
vc_wc,Yeah I figured but I'd let the expert chime in
vc_wc,"I believe the second picture it's purportedly a rolex. 

I sent op here thinking you could help with that one. I can't imagine many people bother faking the other brands"
vc_wc,You can ask /r/rolex - they have a dedicated thread for it
vc_wc,"Your second link goes to a Breitling post.

Also, maybe I'm alone on this or I need more time, but my first impression is that I don't like the new releases. 

Part of the beauty of the cocktail time, was it's understated look. Now with the blue hands or gold rose markets, it just pops too much.

If you add the lower grade movement, then really the recommendation should be the last model instead of the new releases.
"
vc_wc,"Really blown away how this is not higher up in this list.

Sometimes this sub might as well be /r/seiko
"
vc_wc,"Thanks for being honest. If you have not added a review of the original seller, you should do it, so it doesn't happen again. "
vc_wc,"I am with you on this one. The other sold for $425 (or maybe a little less) and it had an extra bracelet and NATO, and it had box and papers.


Good for you OP - as you said, you are in no need to sell so nothing wrong with pricing it as you'd like. But the other one sold a week ago is not a straight comparison."
vc_wc,What's the approximate trade value?
vc_wc,Trying this NATO on the [Speedy Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/tkLQkqe) since it didn't dazzle or impress many on the [white dial yesterday](https://imgur.com/1sSt2K5)
vc_wc,"I agree. I thought the blue would be closer to the blue hands. 

Next I will try a grey perlon maybe. Also a blue and white NATO might look alright.

Thanks for the comment"
vc_wc,I think everyday someone is wearing an Alpinist. And everytime I see it I want to get one
vc_wc,"nice shot, I like the almost exact symmetry..."
vc_wc,"Trying out a different NATO on my [Speedy Pro Moonphase with White Dial and Blue Broad Arrow Hands](https://imgur.com/1sSt2K5)

Thoughts?"
vc_wc,"I did not realize this was a thing until you just pointed it out....
"
vc_wc,Yeah its a little weird. How about trying a color rubber band? 
vc_wc,"The whole Oris Artelier series is pretty awesome. Nice watch!

BTW, I use this to set my moonphase when i let it lapse too long: http://www.watchnetwork.com/moonphase/"
vc_wc,"First, nice dial. Is the complication hard to setup/update? Also, nice strap with the dual color thread stitching.  whats the size?"
vc_wc,Rare trip out of the watch box to the office for my [Hamilton Jazzmaster Chrono](http://imgur.com/vquS48R) - which BTW i'm up for [trading...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/comments/6ru6up/wttwts_hamilton_jazzmaster_chronograph_h326160/)
vc_wc,That looks really sharp. nice!
vc_wc,"thanks! I couldnt figure out which one I liked most. The guy selling one, happened to have the other one as well - both in mint condition. He gave me a price for both that I just couldnt refuse. 

They are very cool. I decide on them because I will likely keep them both forever - you can always get a regular speedy pro, sell it, and buy another one anytime. But these 2 can be hard to find in good condition."
vc_wc,"Thats a fantastic dial! Are those blue hands? How is the lume? I dont know anything about this watch, whats the movement? What size?"
vc_wc,"The funny part is that they ""fixed"" the chrono hand by making it slimmer in [Ref. 3575.20](http://imgur.com/vCARUDF) but then they used broad arrows, which block more of the moon disc and dates... 

I still love both though!"
vc_wc,"I had similar reservations but it is such a beautiful watch. The date can be hard to read - some people run the chrono to set the hand at 6 instead. The moon is visible most of the time. 

I mean, it is so nice I bought it twice: [Ref. 3576.50](http://imgur.com/b0iN5rp) and [Ref. 3575.20](http://imgur.com/vCARUDF)"
vc_wc,thanks!
vc_wc,Yes indeed
vc_wc,+1 on the raffle - /r/EDC_Raffle will eat it up
vc_wc,How much?
vc_wc,I am not against that - I still like it and wear it; but I am looking to see if there is something else out there.
vc_wc,Today I'm wearing this gorgeous blue dial  [Turn-O-Graph](https://imgur.com/M6keE5P) 
vc_wc,Decided on my [Rolex Turn-O-Graph](https://imgur.com/M6keE5P) for a big meeting today.
vc_wc,I think it does. Where did you get it?
vc_wc,Not enough turn-o-graphs here. Nice example. 
vc_wc,"Back to back days with the [Speedy Pro Moonphase Ref. 3575.20](https://imgur.com/89b4VrB) now with a NATO. 

Just can't get enough of the blue broad arrow hands on the white dial"
vc_wc,"It is rubber - i wanted to test it out as way to dress it down and deal with the heat. 

I find the bracelet too shiny and it gets hot under the sun; and i dont like to sweat into leather. I picked a couple of rubber bands, and a couple of NATOs to try out."
vc_wc,Thanks. I bought the strap on a whim. With a little more thought I would consider a pellon strap in navy. 
vc_wc,Price?
vc_wc,"Damn. Nice gift from your future FIL. At first I thought you meant he was letting you pick one from his own collection.

Would love to take a look at his collection some day"

"
vc_wc,"Hello! I am looking to see if there is any interest in this Hamilton Jazzmaster Chronograph. Ref H326160 with a Valjoux 7750 movement.


This is the predecessor to the H21 calibre Jazzmaster Chrono (ref 32616133).


I won this watch at /r/edc_raffle a few weeks ago and put it in the rotation. I like the heft and size of it, and while I do like the dial - I am not in love with it. I tried the leather strap pictured and it completely dressed it up, so it has good versatility. The movement is a workhorse and all functions work well, with smooth push buttons.


When i received it, I replaced the spring bars with new ones as I took the bracelet off and gave it a good cleaning. The condition is good to very good - it has been worn as part of a rotation.

No major nicks or scratches to the bracelet (other than typical desk diving), no scratches to the glass, case, or bezel beyond normal wear. I am happy to take further pictures upon request.


I have never sold a watch before but we all start somewhere - happy to go through any kind of verification, or meet in person in the NYC area.


I will ship to the US (except HI and AK) - and for now not interested in international shipping but I could be talked into. I am curious to see whats out there so dont be afraid to throw in offers.


My collection is lacking a Diver and a GMT so those wold take priority. No Quartz please. I would consider adding cash or taking cash if needed.

"
vc_wc,"Lazy morning but getting ready to go into the muggy heat. Love the way the blue hands contrast with the white dial on my [Speedmaster Pro Moonphase](https://imgur.com/dDQ0a2f) Ref. 3575.20

What do you think about the blue strap? Thumbs up/down?"
vc_wc,Where did you get the leather strap? And do you like it?
vc_wc,"Working from home today, decided to try a brown leather strap on my [Omega Speedy Pro Moonphase](http://imgur.com/a/Yx0XM) Ref 3576.50

ps. sorry I'm not matching my leathers"
vc_wc,Why not put it back on /u/edc_raffle? It probably fills up quickly. 
vc_wc,"Really digging the strap. Whats the ref # on that Speedmaster? Is it a cal. 1861?
