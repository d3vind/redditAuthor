srbistan,koala smiles from above
srbistan,"[ofelas AKA pathfinder 1987](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093668/) grim and somewhat realistic movie from the period and the region, not sure if they were viking or some other tribe."

srbistan,"it is a ransomware hit, in case anybody wonders.... somewhere out there there is a poor business assistant with shit lot of questions to answer in not so pleasant company."
srbistan,"&gt; Walk Hard (sorry had to, it's the best)

that's like 10 bios for the price of one :) seriously, truly great ""zeitgeist"" movie."
srbistan,"[crumb 1994.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109508/) about the elusive father of underground comic and his... rather strange family members, made by his friend terry zwigoff (bad santa, ghost world...). prior to this movie crumb was living like a hermit in france.

people depicted are so weird (in a positive sense, i attribute this to artistic overload in each one of them) this bio-pic feels like a fiction movie.

[Z aka - Zei 1969.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065234/) by kosta gavras, about final days of greek left wing leader grigoris lambrakis. Zei stands for ""he lives"".

[state of siege 1972](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070959/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_18) is one more by gavras, about an infamous CIA agent daniel mitrione, who was captured, tried and executed for his international crimes by the guerilla group tupameros. a shocking and must see lesson in modern history (or at least read about it).

edit:

[dersu uzala AKA hunter dersu 1975](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071411/), a movie made in russian by akira kurosawa, won the 1976 academy award (when it still meant something other than huge marketing budget). movie is based on biography of a russian army cartographer in siberia, where he meets a lone native hunter."

srbistan,"Toygun Atilla! ok, no doubt my name would surely make someone laugh, but this... this is ominous :)"
srbistan,"i live in a country with third largest number of personally owned handguns in the world - mostly illegal military surplus (full autos, explosive ordnance and handheld ATs are common find in police raids) and there has been just one mass shooting in the last ~30 years, committed by a madman (ended up institutionalized) with a double barrel hunting rifle he was licenced holder.

finding a way to hurt vast number of people is unfortunately very easy now days, you don't really need a firearm and few (or quite a few) good guys giving up their plinkers won't do anything in terms of overall safety."
srbistan,"you too, all the best!"
srbistan,"yes and [trains are trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Madrid_train_bombings), [vans are vans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nice_truck_attack), and [planes are planes](http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com)... 

for me a gun is nothing but a tool, but as i said - that is another topic i'd rather not discuss here, and with all due respect - with you, as you are too emotional on the subject."
srbistan,"gun - maybe. way to hurt people - absolutely not. however, that is a different topic IMO."
srbistan,how many potential/wannabe shooters do you think handed in their guns (presuming there are more left)? or violent criminals for that matter?
srbistan,"exactly my point, thank you."
srbistan,"ok, why haven't they turned it in ten days ago?"
srbistan,"no it is a result of a mass hysteria, and that is far from commendable. if they didn't need it (weapons) nor want it they wouldn't have bought it or they would've handed them in  before the attack. "
srbistan,"oh a credible and honest gang member... sure, we'll take it because we're against violence!"
srbistan,and mum is always right.
srbistan,"sure thing, it's just - in my generation this movie is so well known it hardly needs any introduction, that's what i had in mind, absolutely no insult meant. thank you for posting!"
srbistan,"during the punic wars many of the roman plebeians and plebeian tribunes believed patricians are prolonging the war for their own agenda (accumulation of wealth and power mainly) and tried to bring the war to an end through various means ranging from protest gatherings in the forum to mass desertion of an entire legio.

reading about the period (even from a single source - titus livius) makes that very likely, but it didn't do much good to the main roman fighting force - the plebeians as war was fought for almost two decades - until carthage surrendered."

srbistan,"there is ""a catch"" with the croatian coat of arms: if it begins with red square than it is a regular, republican one (the good one :) ).

but a white square symbolizes the NDH, a WW2 Nazi-satellite monstrosity of a state and is considered a neo-nazi call sign in the balkans."

just what kind of person was spike : he had a running joke ""i told you i was ill"", which he wanted to be written on his gravestone as an epitaph, but the church authorities wouldn't let him write that.

so he asked a parish to write something in his native gaelic, which was OK with the church. he wrote : i told you i was ill - in gaelic.

spike was a remnant of the old times (born in british india), a warrior, a musician, an actor, a writer and a very gentle and kind man. "

srbistan,"had one client recently with a cocker reactive to kids and electrical vehicles, and we sorted it out in two or three months, working one day a week with a trainer. the dog is a pet-store buy, most likely mistreated by children (excessive petting, probably some painful XP) prior to being bought by a truly great young lady who gave the dog love and care she deserves.

first we did some rudimentary handler training (reasoning with humans is usually the biggest problem, this time i was lucky!), than some basic obedience, afterwards some high speed socialization, practicing couple of silly to look at scenarios (ask yourself - how do you make friends with a trolleybus?), had two different children assistants (bunch of other kids in the streets helped out a lot too and i'm very grateful) and we finally tested with ""live"" kids creating havoc (passed with flying colours).

i have a bunch of unhappy stories too, in case you decide to slack in your dog training :) 

look mate, i know it can be hard, frustrating, painful, disappointing  and what not, but don't give up. setting a dog straight... well, there are very, very few more rewarding feelings, IMO."

srbistan,"glad you two made it ok, and i'm sorry you got so stressed, but it wasn't such a big deal believe me. these things happen, far worse things happen - like serious attacks with serious consequences. be prepared for these too... its not pleasant thought but it is better than to freak out and freeze when it happens.

one (non-aggressive) thing you could do to protect your dog is an automatic umbrella (patent - those activate by a button, not sure what they're called in english) . if you open it in a dog's face, it is almost certain you will scare the living crap out of him. you can also use it as a shield of a sort, in case the other dog is VERY persistent (though i never seen an untrained dog not panicking on an umbrella, they just can't seem to comprehend it and back off).

really nice kid, smart, cute, clean, not too shy but well behaved -  except he is totally uninterested in dogs or pretty  much anything that doesn't have a screen. no fear, no investigative desire, doesn't want to play with the dog... i was stunned, really didn't see that coming and thought the dog was going to be the problem.

at all times kid kept staring into a TV screen, almost emotionless during the whole ordeal (managed to get him to interact with a dog for a few brief moments). at one point his mum gave him a smartphone and you could clearly see the little fella waking up. he starts laughing, showing things on phone around...

i'm not a luddite, far, far from it - got my first computer when i was 6 (they where uncommon back then, pre PC era)  but if this kid was in my class when i was his age people would consider him mentally challenged or autistic. "

the only reason these dogs behave this way is because they are pampered by their owners and unaware what's the price of such behaviour in a dog pack.

unfortunately where i live there are a lots of strays, packs of them actually - and believe me, smaller dogs do know they are smaller and behave accordingly."
srbistan,"&gt; Chickens, however, would lay lots of eggs and reproduce fairly quickly just like today. So it's likely that chicken would have been a more commonly eaten meat along with fish, and then pork sparingly.

as for shootings and bombings i thought about this a lot myself. ducking, face down fast, can save your life - full stop and hardly anyone can disagree on this. IMHO every single person in household should know how to ""hit the deck"", but the proper way - without injuring oneself. 

it's just trying out one simple movement routine (right foot forward as much as possible, which will lower your hips, than drop on your left forearm - it's less than a second). it's not like it's some kind of ninja move, but there is more to it than just dropping on the ground like in the movies (and breaking arm in the process).

also, mass attacks often lead to mass panic and stampede - one should be able to predict crowd movement direction and avoid being squashed against solid objects by the crowd. 

people should be aware of common terrorist tactic of time delayed bombing, with the second charge is being aimed at wannabe rescuers - do not be a dead hero, leave S&amp;R to professionals, move away from the scene."

srbistan,"decent (sharp and with a good leverage) nail clippers. also, you don't need to clip entire excess nail at once, you can do it bit by bit (first the pointy bit, than the lower part of the ""square"" that remains, than again the point you just made and so on until you get to desired length). 

i never had problems with that, and my clippers aren't all that good TBH. i also have a metal file which i use for finish (filing in from outside to inside direction of the nail).


handling their paws since the young age and making them accustomed to nail clipping is essential, i knew people who needed to (mildly) sedate their dogs to be able to do this. there is absolutely no need to dope up a dog to do it IF you had it from young age and have trained it.

i would be VERY careful with adopted dogs, however, and would not do it without 8-muzzle for the first few times, until totally sure it's safe. rotties are kind giants, but (as you aware) are extremely dangerous and can mess you up for life in a single bite (dangerous and aggressive aren't synonyms, i mean dangerous as in ""has potential to fuck you up big time"") and when you do this your face is too close to dog's mouth to be able to evade if anything goes wrong.

[murphy's war 1971.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067458/) is a war movie starring peter o toole and philippe noiret (coup de torchon; cinema paradiso) both of which are brilliant. o'toole crazed by his entire ship's crew being massacred by an U-boat goes on personal vendetta against submarine, totally disregarding his life, lives of others and any law or decency. o'toole acting a madman reminds me of his role in ""man friday"".

the deluge 1933 [YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d35Got0OKQ), most likely first disaster/post-apocalyptic movie ever made. i found it a bit naive and racist, but if not judged by today's standards it's pleasing to see. scenes of destruction are surprisingly good and it deals with social fabric degradation in a way that points out what values people hold in high esteem back then.

srbistan,in russia hot dogs eat you.
srbistan,"did you try feeding your dog some of the BBQ or lamb, once the scent of cooking/BBQ-ing clears out? just to determine whether the scent of meat itself or something related to process of food preparation triggers this?

i'd suppose something traumatic happened to the dog when he was young which he relates to preparing food. to be clear - i'm not saying it is in any way your fault, ""something traumatic"" can be something benign enough for us, at the time, to go totally unnoticed.

it could be something really silly, such as sound of a metal brush one uses to clean the BBQ grid, or he got smacked when tried to ""help himself"" to your food when he was very young, or got burned on a fire pit (place where you make BBQ, sorry -  not sure what it's called in english)... even a spicy hot piece of BBQ someone once gave him could be the reason.

every dog is unique individual, and some dogs are more sensitive  than others. using elimination process try to determine what exactly triggers him. once you do that you can fix the problem by gradually exposing your dog to whatever he fears and relating that to a pleasurable experience.

i had a rottie that survived a car crash in which his handler got killed, and he would ""shut down"" when exposed to noise. it took me few months (of doing crazy things - as flapping plastic bags, throwing cooking pans in the kitchen and zeroing in on train stations few meters closer each day) to fix  that but i did it. some dogs are unfortunately scared beyond point of return, such as the one i'm caring for at the moment - a badly abused stray. but we had HUGE progress over the past few years from pissing ourselves when looked at to cheerfully greeting house guests at the front door.

i'm glad you realize how dangerous can this be to your friend, if you can't fix it yourself a behaviorist would be a good idea. if you can't afford it and if you think what i wrote made sense feel free to PM me for a few ideas."

edit: probably a bit naive by modern standards, but apart from that quite a decent movie, well worth watching if you're into the genre. it struck me how laborious it must've been making such a movie in that era, you can clearly see the effort put into making of it. scenes of destruction use FX waay ahead of it's time, far superior to most 50es era movies.

srbistan,"yesterday was the anniversary of US lead NATO bombardment of serbia, which resulted in kosovo independence, claimed by ethnic albanians. kosovo was part of serbia since the middle ages, a place of national pride, sort of like serbian alamo (only with turks)... 

since the NATO troops came in more than 80% of native serbian population evacuated fearing for their life, twenty years after the war ethnically motivated crimes against serbs are rampant.

there has been a number of documented terrorist attacks by albanians, including the [attacks on US military personal in europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Frankfurt_Airport_shooting). kosovo has the highest number of ISIL fighters from balkans and it's a hotspot for human and drugs trafficking... to this day kosovo independence is contested by people of serbia and few other nations, and guess who is THE strongest backer pressing heavily for us to give in?

i could go on for days, and yes - what US did still hurts and is not a justice whatever mass media might be preaching. 

so, simply saying ""europe did it to themselves"" shows quite a lot of denial or ignorance."

many rookies got few gray hairs there, and we often had soldiers volunteering to pull entire night's shift, just to avoid walking back to the barracks accompanied by the spooky choir. personally i was more worried when they would go quiet, as it meant there is something nastier around - a wild boar or a human.

during my stint there i learned to love and respect those creatures. little rascals are stealthy, cute, smart, very sociable among themselves and our unit, disbanded loooong ago, was named after them - ""pristan jackals"" (we weren't cute, nor smart but probably smelled worse, hence the name). "

srbistan,damn this looks beautiful.
srbistan,"oh yes... very, very underrated movie."
srbistan,"since you are the second person replying similarly, let me explain what i had in mind (my rather poor english limits my capability to express myself clearly and concisely)... 

weapons are made to fit strategy or tactics, and strategy governing the use of nuclear weapons is MAD. hopefully there will be no nuclear exchange at all, but if it happens - it won't be limited. if you believe russia and china would sit on their asses while NATO contaminates their borders you better rethink.

and when that happens it won't be like ""13 women"" or ""fallout"", not even ""the road"" - it will be ""the threads"".  there IS NO SUCH THING AS RADAWAY - radiation is permanent and deadly, and ugly kind of deadly too.
now i'm not saying we should sit down, cry and die, but ""the oft-ridiculed duck-and-cover strategy is actually surprisingly effective "" is what really got me going - come on, please... it's 21. century there are tons of info available - you can't possibly believe that crap?

list of people who have $TRONG REA$ON to convince other people surviving nuclear holocaust is viable option is quite long, prepping is an industry, and has been growing steadily since sixties. prepping is all about survival, and your best survival option (one NK people do not have) is to pressure your politicians to stop fucking around with nuclear weapons.

srbistan,"we're talking meltdown VS ground level nuclear EXPLOSION that raises minuscule particles that carry nuclear material in the air and disperse them over wide area. although there is far more nuclear material in a reactor, you don't need large quantity of it to cause deadly pollution, you just need to disperse it well.

wildlife in pripyat is thriving in terms of numbers of wild animals, as there are no humans. however, there are no conclusive studies on longevity of individual animals. that is - there are many wolves, but there aren't as many OLD wolves, nor is anyone willing to risk their lives to do the studies.
do you really think place would be uninhabited if there was prospect of living there? do you have any idea what would happen if you dig under the top soil (needed for farming, and i can only imagine the what quality of ground water in a well would be). hell even when you stroll of the paved roads and you go into higher grass geiger counter starts acting crazy.

""we"" had either atmospheric or underground (underground and underwater) testing, and those very few done on the surface were done using payloads of infinitely lower yields than modern ones. those tests were carefully designed NOT TO raise any radiation if possible, as the other side would know what to expect from their opponent. and guess what - they made a deal not to do it anymore, because they were too dangerous in the long run.

the only thing that scares me more than having loonies with thousands of nuclear warheads in the neighbourhood are the people shortsighted enough to actually believe they are going to survive. in fact - yes, you could survive, but i'm far from certain quality of life would be really worth surviving."
srbistan,"one word about overestimating dangers of nuclear radiation for you dude - fukushima. you go tell them they have nothing to worry about, stupid japanese people panicking over nothing... afterwards you could drop to the pripyat region and claim the land for yourself - no worries, the accident was &gt;30 years ago.

duck and cover?! jesus fuck... are you serious? 

as for the book from the sixties (unfortunately the link is down momentarily but i'll check it out) you do realize government needed a way to assure general public there is a significant chance of survival even if that wasn't entirely true because the society could fall apart during cuban missile crisis. if it's government issue - it's a literature with the agenda.

i'm from SE europe, rather far away from pripyat in ukraine, and i know for fact most veggies weren't safe to eat. and that one power plant was nothing (in terms of fallout generated) compared to one ground detonated city-buster.

finally - google : ""Low-background steel"" to get the clearer picture of just how dangerous and penetrating radiation is.

"
srbistan,"if lack of few minutes would kill you instantly - a few minutes notice would probably just prolong your agony. there is no long term surviving all out nuclear war for number of reasons.

srbistan,"you do realize ""sllobo"" was ousted 17 years ago? that almost two decades FFS! your mantra about evil serbs has grown rather thin lately, and as you can see in NY times truth about islamism in kosmet is slowly creeping out. from now on it's just a matter of accepting reality.

and before you even begin - i was among those who stormed the national parliament when we got rid of milosevic in a revolution. you'd have to look VERY hard if you are to find someone who disliked the bastard and what he did more than myself."

i heard about this from a news article, some genius played this in children reserved time slot resulting in thousands of complaints, as this is anything but kids cartoon.

i like to watch german WW2 movies, as they tend to be more sincere and have (not so) subtle note of warning in them. few examples : 

[die brücke 1958.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Br%C3%BCcke_%28film%29) (the bridge)

[Hunde, wollt ihr ewig leben 1959.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxS7uFNX4sk) (dogs, do you want to live forever? )

[stalingrad 1993.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108211/)

[generation war 2013. miniseries](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1883092/)

germans have truly great cinematography, fassbinder is one of my favorites (werner herzog was already mentioned...) and could recommend more or less any piece of celluloid he had his fingers on:
[ali, fear eats the soul](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071141/) is a great drama.

[american soldier](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065391/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_36), a noir crime movie.


oh, and mandatory german Z movie : [rammbock 2010.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1583356/)  (the battering ram).

two - it's not an accident if you shoot someone while shooting blindfolded, it's negligence.

three - according to the geneva convention bombing of a hospital IS a war crime be it military or civilian facility, end of story. no amount of whitewash is going to change that."

srbistan,essentially - to cheat instead rely on your own skills?
srbistan,"i don't think he has any saying in this anymore, as i have rad he sold the game. besides, he created (or copied and made popular) a great game concept which will (hopefully) mutate into decent game, once fixed. so, thanks zeach is more appropriate IMO.

however i understand your frustration and need to vent it :)"
srbistan,"splitting to feed a teamer takes greater skill than feeding and it's much easier to make a mistake that way. i think disabling W (as the simplest solution) would help.

it wouldn't solve the problem entirely, but you wouldn't have dozens of teams comprised of god damn noobs plaguing every single bloody server."
srbistan,"i completely agree with you, unfortunately game owners don't agree with us."
srbistan,"OP, you are living my dream."
srbistan,OP delivers! cheers m8 :)
srbistan,"it doesn't take extensive algorithm to fix the problem it just takes to limit mass transfer by clicking W, or ban it totally (as it serves no real purpose in the game anyhow).

srbistan,"limit the mass exchange between blobs to fixed number, say between 100 and 300 and that's it.

but as one redditor pointed out few days ago - teamers = site visitors, site visitors = traffic, traffic = $$$. end of story IMO."
srbistan,"well i'll be... that's a new level of low, haven't seen that before.
"
srbistan,"i'll try that, thanks. i never even visited agariomods, as i like to play games ""raw"", but this is becoming quite unbearable.

as for zeach's ""slack"", there was a discussion about teamplay, similar to this one, and one user pointed out the reason why this problem isn't solved although it's fairly easily solvable : teamers (mostly players who wouldn't get anywhere on their own) are traffic also, and traffic=money. can't say if it's 100% truth, but it makes a lot of sense IMO."
srbistan,"oh, that's too local for me, i'm not even american (although familiar with US politics, hard not to be), question was more hypothetical and general :)"
srbistan,"one truly amazing movie, first david gulpilil's movie i believe. this and ""wake in fright"" got me hooked on aussie cinema."
srbistan,"never thought of it that way, but yes, it makes sense... "
srbistan,"i was thinking a lot about this behavior, personally i find it fascinating. is it a cowardice, stockholm syndrome, easiest way to ""success"" or just plain old stupidity (most of those helping already formed teams get eaten as soon as the threat to the team is over)? either way it's annoying as hell, but interesting nevertheless."
srbistan,i wonder if our children are going to look at our era drug busts the same way we look at these prohibition arrests. 
srbistan,"i have this stupid problem, i hate betraying people's trust, even in trivial things such as agar... few times i myself got into teamplay by giving back mass given to me by other blobs, which they interpreted as an teamplay invitation. numerous times i just gave up and went on another server, but on occasions (usually when there is/are  other team/s present) i would remain and spread misery. not proud to admit that, but there it is."
srbistan,hunger games?
srbistan,"i'm not kidding, i haven't seen team-free game for so long i can't even remember when it was, and i do play A LOT.

ie. yesterday i was at a brand new server (everyone starting as tiny dots.) and i was amazed how fast people formed teams, they were only 100-200 mass and teaming up... i was thinking - how the fuck do they know whom to team up with?!"
srbistan,"wooow, i'd write that date down if i were you."
srbistan,"hey, we're spectating the same server! :)"
srbistan,"pressing a number on a keyboard (0-9) during the spectator mode, corresponding to leaderboard place, to follow that blob would be nice. No 1 is often boring."

srbistan,"right UR, cheers. poor choice of words on my behalf, but english is my second language."
srbistan,i second this
srbistan,"people seem to be forgetting that point of this game is not how to fool teams. mechanism to prevent this pestilence is something that needs to be implemented in the game mechanics itself, as game is becoming truly pointless due to the number of them.

on better days i can deal with 1-2 teams, but as soon as you eradicate one bunch of these inbred fucktards another group pops up... on some servers i ask myself - is there anyone at all playing this as single player.

god damn mass transfer needs to be limited to 100-200 (in case you see someone with funny nick you want to help take off in the beginning) and 3/4 of the problem is solved."
srbistan,"although i fully understand what you are talking about, the notion of circle having front and back sides is amusing."
srbistan,"just limit mass transfer from blob to another blob to 100-200 (or any other number community finds consensus on), and you made teaming very hard. sure, there are other ways of passing a mass to another player, but they take far greater skill than just W-ing.

i think it's that simple. and i do agree it's a problem ruining gameplay."
srbistan,"i really enjoy milo's videos, he's a wonderful dog. kiss that superstar in making for me pls. 

btw ""milo"" means ""something dear"" in south slavic languages - quite appropriate name IMO."
srbistan,they are NOT people... [they're cops](/spoiler)
srbistan,"you're missing the point too complex to explain, sorry about that. friendly hint - most of those hitlers, stalins and god knows what else weren't racists but trolls and polandball is, mostly, a satire, not illustrated history."
srbistan,"i often use spectate mode to see who is teaming up before i start playing, now that is not possible and it's regretful. one more thing about spectate mode, it wouldn't be such a bad idea if you could focus on people from leaderboard by pressing a keyboard number corresponding to place you want to focus on.

for what is worth - if this game looked like this first time i saw it i would never play. hitlers, isis and swastikas flying all around gave it that ""politically incorrect"" feel polandball has, now it's more or less yet another FB fad and it could've been cult game.

nevertheless thanks for all the fun i had so far Zeach, i really mean it. all the best!"
srbistan,"haven't seen a decent horror in a long time,  this one surpassed my expectations by far. IMO far better than babadook.

srbistan,"[flame and citron 2008.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0920458/) is danish move about resistance movement in denmark. historically accurate, emotional and action packed... truly wonderful film if you don't mind ""foreign"" movies.

i saw recently a TV series called ""combat"", fairly good to excellent (depending on the episode) with some surprisingly good guest star appearances (tely savalas, leonard nimoy...)

there is a chinese WW2 movie about a forlorn company waiting for the bugle sound to retreat, which never came, but for the life of me i can't remember it's name, if someone does, please reply (i'll edit post if/when i remember)."
srbistan,"this is surprisingly good and honest WW2 movie. compared with ""the fury"" it's fucking masterpiece in every possible aspect except the budget."
srbistan,"just came here to ask about this, so it's not only you, but in my case it has nothing to do with accumulated mass, it happens even in spectate mode. balls and viruses also disappear. 

you might be right it's due to the lag, as game is next to impossible to play now (sunday afternoon)."
srbistan,"surely there are lots of things to criticize about stalin, but people often equate USSR and russia and add stalin on top of it. just historically inaccurate and reeks of propaganda (as person i replied to said : gruzyan conquered europe for russians... yeah right).

i think if stalin wasn't such a loony, as he was, germans would've won the WW2."
srbistan,you are aware stalin was not russian?
srbistan,"before his second term? honestly, i'm not sure, but i'd bet not."

instead you claim 70 strong raiding party fighting police for two days was organized by government of macedonia to prevent one protest no different to those they (government) had in previous days? 

if so, and just in case you're not UCK shill, i would suggest you rethink odds for that, and i will show myself out of this discussion as i'm not really sure if you're trolling."

but in all honesty - what you've said is painfully right, for the time being."
srbistan,"UCK claimed responsibility for the attack, what exactly are you trying to say? "
srbistan,"i'm not claiming anything, i'm trying to clear out few things for people not so well versed in balkan politics. 

multinational means : many nations live in that place. when you say ""people from kosovo"" it's not clear enough are they albanians, serbs, montenegrins, romanis or something else. and they were albanians from kosovo, belonging to the infamous UCK terrorist group which claimed responsibility for latest atrocity (hopefully shutting up those stupid enough to claim macedonian government initiated attack on their own state)."
srbistan,"no, hitler was a serious problem, where albanian expansionism itself is just a blight. i said you have about the same chance of getting UN seat as hitler had to rule the world. and he said ""it was just a matter of time"" for his delusional aspirations too."
srbistan,"hitler said the same about conquering the world...

with china and russia (who just happen to be permanent UN security council members) being strongly against that shithole, built on organ theft and drug money, you call ""independent kosovo"" - not very likely. 

what is more, as soon as you loose backing of the US (which will inevitably happen, considering albanian involvement in [terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid_Uka) worldwide) - all those neighbours you pissed off for so long (greece, romania, bulgaria, serbia, italy)  will have a thing or two to tell you in private."

Ovi su potegli stvar i turski zapovednik grada je naredio da se svi beogradski psi pohvataju i ukrcaju na jedan brod. Kada je to učinjeno, brod je zaplovio Dunavom, da bi svoj tovar istresao na drugu obalu, koja je pripadala Austriji. 
Na sredini Dunava jedan od pasa skočio je sa broda i zaplivao natrag, kući. Za njim su u tren oka poskakali u talase i svi ostali i vratili se u Beograd

srbistan,"well ain't this interesting,  when a goat farts in afghanistan - it's a terrorist attack, but when 70 armed albanians belonging to the UCK (which was on the US terror list  not so long ago) stage an attack on police - it's ""an armed group clashing with police""...

tiger tank was vastly superior to any allied tank of the WW2. total number of units produced ~1400. sherman tank, inferior to german equivalent at the time, units produced : ~50.000 . true, tiger was better, but not 35 times better.

i despise, however, people who, in lack of arguments would try to discredit one's personality. judging someone's opinion based on place of his birth is called racism, and that's one more thing i despise."
srbistan,which part of what i said makes you think i am?
srbistan,"i know they're having effect, but i think russia will be able to adept by focusing on other markets. other than that, sanctions hurt european economies too, weaker ones especially and greece and slovakia could ignore them in recent future.

edit:

one more thing, my country was under sanctions for very long time, and they did fuck all to the ""ruling class"", their cronies and military apparatus. they only hurt common people, polarizing quite a few against ""west""."
srbistan,"USSR was closed economy for so long and it still survived. expecting economic sanctions would do russia serious harm in a long run, now they are opened to BRIC (and other markets) and have significantly less military expenses is so naive i suspect it was only done for purpose of internal political consumption in the west."

even bible mentions jews, and they aren't christians AFAIK. 

you've seen complex machinery, such as cars, airplanes? been to doctor or knew people who had? have you had a TV set? you sound too curious, well spoken and intelligent to let all that pass as ""his creation"" IMO.

most people chatting here with you take the superior stance, which awfully reminds me of early christian missionaries ""enlightening savages"", so i'm all for this little lesson you're teaching. hope you're having fun, i am."
srbistan,"no fucking way, this gotta be a troll. come on people, we're not talking about amazon tribal, this person was born in the US, has seen a car, TV, been to doctor... i don't buy this, we're being mega trolled, with style and grace though."

i was more interested in general, what use solids would be (even in modern heavy artillery). could artillery really be precise enough to be used for AP tasks? so far harassing fire and training seem most plausible. "

srbistan,forever moogather.
srbistan,"harassing fire, yes that makes sense, and from what i read about it - it had effect as you described.

i asked in case there was something about artillery i totally misunderstood (in terms of usability), as propellant isn't cheap, flash can give away position and barrel wears out."
srbistan,"yeah i know, but what's the chance of hitting anything with such a large caliber? AFAIK it doesn't shoot straight (like 88mm at that time), but in curve."

I travelled, I travelled (Translation)

I travelled and travelled far and wide
I met happy Gypsies
I travelled and travelled far and wide
I met lucky Gypsies

Oh, Gypsies, Oh guys
Oh, Gypsies, Oh guys

Oh, Gypsies, from wherever you came from
With your tents along lucky roads
I once had a large family too
But the black legion murdered them

Come with me, Gypsies of the world
For the Gypsies, roads have been opened
Now is the time – arise, Gypsies
We will go far if we act!

Oh, Gypsies, Oh, guys
Oh, Gypsies, Oh, guys"

srbistan,"this isn't exactly a theory, it is happening in present time, melting siberian permafrost releasing methane trapped in it.

due to the global warming permafrost is melting (so much for ""perma"" part of it...) and releasing methane, HUGE quantities of it and methane is a potent greenhouse gas, way more dangerous to climate than carbon dioxide. warmer it gets, more it melts, and process runs faster and faster. i hope we're not past the point where something can be done. 

bonus - there is so much methane stuck in permafrost that it could (in theory) change the composition of air on our planet, possibly making it unbreathable for creatures evolved to breath air like we're having now."
srbistan,"before you try anything else (in terms of medications or artificially made lotions) maybe you could wash your dog's eyes with camomile tea for a week and see if it gets better.

srbistan,"oh, i see... from what i've heard (never been there) immigrants are second class citizens for all practical purposes in UEA. maybe that e-shocker would be a good idea then. also, most dogs are terrified by patent umbrella opened in their face."
srbistan,"firecrackers (can scare your dogs too), pepper spray (can hurt you and your dogs too), ASP baton or electric shocker (GSDs can turn on you). if it was one dog you could beat it into submission, but 2-3 ... you could end up badly mauled or dead against that many dogs.

what country are you in, if i may inquire? why not try talking to the police with a local translator first. it that fails you could talk to GSDs owner politely, warning them of possible consequences and lastly arm yourself with large-grain salt loaded shotgun.

for salt loaded shotgun please [READ THIS](http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=86797) - it can be lethal.

srbistan,"smokes had enormous value in war torn places in former YU. canned food, medicine, gasoline, coffee and smokes were probably THE most luxurious goods of all.

the thing is - trade (larger scale one, anything more than 1k cigarettes i would say) was controlled by organized crime syndicates, and they're not exactly friendliest competition. these kind of things attract seriously unwanted attention. if it wasn't for this i would say it's a good idea.

in vacuum sealed packs smokes don't have ""shelf life"", as far as smokers are concerned - they last forever. if kept dry, to avoid molding that is. when cigarettes dry too much and tobacco starts to crumble into powder you can rehydrate it by adding apple peal, piece of cabbage or something similar in a plastic bag with it."

srbistan,"&gt; Your distinction between fear and 'fearful reactions' appears only to be whether the behavior is tolerable or undesirable, which doesn't even take into account where the behavior stems from.

"
srbistan,"source : personal experience. i'm not trying to sell you anything, feel free to ignore me, just don't misinterpret my words please or at least be aware you are doing that."
srbistan,"yes you can reinforce emotional responses, but seeing you made up your mind on the subject - fair enough. having ""fixed"" two stray dogs adopted from streets who were scared out of their wits i have pretty good idea what i'm talking about.

i thought my distinction between fear and fearful reaction was simple enough, obviously that was not the case, but it's not what you understood, or rather - misunderstood."
srbistan,"i tried to keep it short and not to go into details... if you notice your dog is acting nervously, you reassure the dog he/she is safe and OK by talking calm and soft to him (just acting nervous, not actually doing anything that could be memorized as a ""scenario"") and try to move forward/not back off  from the perceived threat or just stand there until dog gets accustomed to it.

you can also come to the ""threat"" yourself and start stroking it (my dog had irrational fear from car trailers... i must've looked crazy stroking car trailer, but it worked) at the same time encouraging your dog to approach it. some things can take longer for dog to accept."
srbistan,"if you see your dog is acting nervously, it's time to encourage the dog (praising, petting...). if your dog is, for instance, running behind you or snapping - that is undesired reaction and should be either ignored or discouraged.

edit: 

many people would take their, madly barking dog, in their arms, which is probably the most common way of reinforcing fearful reaction."

srbistan,dear god what an awful movie. can't believe this was made in 1989. it looks (and sounds) like early seventies with a cast of Z grade porn actors from the same period.
srbistan,"love that pickaxe just standing there ""i didn't do nothing""."
srbistan,"with ""current political climate"" - where you have one block, using conventional weaponry, pressing hard the other, impoverished one, which still controls vast mountainous region to hide it's ""elite"" and military installations , all out nuclear conflict doesn't seem at all impossible. 
who does the ""shunning""? western military coalition despised in the east for warmongering? cuba was shunned, north korea, syria, russia - and they just don't care. so much for that shunning bit.

it's not pointless. when you know exactly (more or less)  how many nuclear missiles are coming, you know how much AA you need, where to aim your missiles and so on. strategy dictates what percentage of those missiles launched need to be destroyed to ensure ""survival"" or ""victory"". country would try to build sufficient, but not superfluous AA in order not to spend to much resources. if you have hundred times more missiles coming for you - you could still (in those few minutes left) surrender and avoid total annihilation and not retaliate. 

""i think"" is an expression of personal belief, stemming from various experiences that can not be as easily backed by what you call credible sources. i'm not expecting you to believe me, i wouldn't if i were you, but i'm surprised anybody anywhere believes what military is saying and those scientist's estimates are based on what military has told them.

take for example a biological weaponry based on viruses that were supposedly banned and destroyed, but was later found out that was not the case - they were stored in polar regions of our planet. that kind of military deception and secrecy i'm talking about. from my personal experience with military that uses former eastern block doctrine - they lie about everything, strengths, weaknesses - everything. i don't see why would any other military be any different in that aspect."
srbistan,"difference in opinion. for you it seems there is no reason, for me the reason for deception is quite obvious."
srbistan,"it's common logic to stockpile weapons when you are readying for a conflict of any kind. more the better - as you can't know how well the opponent is dug in and how many of them are going to survive and possibly attack again.

most nuclear launching sites are known and targeted by the opposing side (speaking of RUS-USA). i strongly believe many of these are dummies and there are unmarked, well hidden, sites operated remotely. times of ""brightly colored uniforms that intimidate enemy"" are long gone...

i would like to point out the ""estimate"" part of your quote, which means that even people seriously into the matter aren't certain how many fireworks are there. i'm not being delusional that i know how many nukes (put simply) are there, but i think (for number of reasons) there are more than people suppose. IMO regardless of how many - there are too much of them."
srbistan,"came back with a pitchfork?! moron must've liked it in the hospital... some people just don't realize dogs are part of the family for some of us.

srbistan,isn't that how they used to make air fresheners back in the day (western front ie.)? silly thing buying them when you can make your own...
srbistan,you really believe these numbers? for instance - would you tell your enemy how many bullets do you have in your gun?
srbistan,"yes, but a very special one. as you probably saw it was made by jarmusch, meaning - the action part of it is just a wrapper and cohesive material for weird humor and some deeper thoughts. some people i spoke to dismiss it as a shallow movie, but i think it deals with themes often found in asian movies (loyalty, fairness, friendship, higher motives...) set up in western culture.

srbistan,"&gt; The term Bosnian Croat or Bosnian Serb is only used when discussing the 90's war with foreigners.

srbistan,"actually i'm from europe and i live near danube river, so we don't really have that problem - we have a flooding problems.

sure you can go around the ban, and i suppose it's not as rigorously enforced, but the idea that someone felt free to ban people from collecting rain water, making moonshine or growing tomato on a patch in front of your house irritates me, as i don't see reasonable justification for that.

i mean, how many people you know who harvest water? i believe you know more factories harmful to waterways than individuals who would have impact on ecosystem by collecting rainwater. besides, stored water isn't going anywhere - you must ""give"" it back eventually."
srbistan,"they have this guy counting rain drops and if he finds any of them missing scully and mulder are all over you.

seriously though, this seems so unfair (very mildly put) when you think of all the water industry pollutes. i honestly thought this is a joke before i read more about it. all i can think now is soylent green."

like those multimillionaires sitting surrounded by beautiful paintings soulless agents bought for them from sotheby's catalogue.

no insult intended op, but that's how i see it. and i will check the list to see if there is something that interests me."
srbistan,"i wouldn't be so sure in stating either, one can't really tell for sure, unless deep in the muck on ukraine-russian border. in nineties, during wars in former yugoslavia, there was this phenomena of weekend soldiers. regular people who would take friday off and go from friday till sunday fighting the war.

i knew different kinds of people who used to do this, and typical groups were : primarily heavily indoctrinated common people fighting for nationalistic or religious reasons, then people with roots/relatives in troubled regions, after them came common criminals who went looting, kidnapping/ransoming -  anything for profit ""enterprises"" and finally loonies of all kinds - rapists, sadists, avengers, adrenaline junkies and so on.

regular army personal from yugoslavian army were common to volunteer (habitually using their officially issued gear), as they were one of the most indoctrinated people in the country. you really couldn't blame it on the state itself, as there were no official orders nor incentives to go fighting. true - there weren't consequences neither, but why would've been (hypothetical question, from perspective of the state)?

knowing the mentality slavic people very well, and soviet military doctrine (russian isn't much different, and yugoslavian was almost identical) i believe story behind russian involvement in ukraine is similar as that of YU soldiers in bosnia. "
srbistan,"i don't agree with you about removal of all lens flared videos, hear me out please : 

i've seen this movie ages ago, liked it a lot, and forgot it's name. after seeing a link (name sounded familiar) to it here and having a chance to see what is it about  i remembered how much i liked it and will get from... another source.

there i am, just a kid at the time, panting and trying to catch my breath, thinking ""oh fuck"", bunch of shady people (likely all armed) staring at my dog in grim silence, dog happily blinking back at them, drooling all over their latest ""investment"".  few seconds of  pythonesque ""the good, bad and the ugly"", aura of doom in the air... then one of those guys started laughing, rest of them joined and we (surprisingly) didn't end up as a rat snack in a nearest manhole."

srbistan,"i befriended a chief dog trainer in a company i used to work for and he told me a story when he (for a bet with his cop friend, who confirmed the story) convinced his class of security dog handlers, some 4-5 guys, to jerk their dogs off. at first they, naturally, were reluctant to do so, but as the class lasted several weeks he slowly talked them into doing it using some primitive psychology.

first he convinced them it's normal thing to do, that it's something all top of the range handlers do, but won't admit for obvious reasons (he is VERY reputable in his field of work, world famous like so people tend to believe him).

""come on mate, would you tell that to your friends? of course you wouldn't - it's not like it's considered normal thing to do, but that's the secret of the trade..."". ""but since you're all OK guys and paying me a lot of money i'm telling you, but you need to keep quiet about it"". ""i used to do it all the time, i would show you how but my boy is neutered now."" and so on...   

then he went on to tell them it's good for bonding with the animal, and that dogs will be more obedient and loyal if they do it. after a while he picked one guy and started praising his ""excellent dog handling ability"" (people get really competitive about who makes better team with his dog), to raise his self esteem and confidence and asked him did he ""do it"".  after that one poor, curious soul admitted, one by one most of other guys jerked their dogs off in following days... 

i miss that bloke, he was a real nutter, but in the best possible way. ie. we would get an ounce of hash from the local police, for training purposes, and would return like - 5grams. he would just say : ""dogs ate it, good thing they didn't die... again"".

srbistan,"i agree that overextending is detrimental, but according to the report by jürgen tödenhoffer (only western journalist to visit daesh and come back to tell about it) their numbers are greatly underestimated. taking into account how long it took and what was needed to stop them at kobane (which is just a few miles away from nearest NATO member state) they seem to have manpower.

as for justification of ground troops from any part of the modern world - i think they're way past that point. burning people alive, beheading, rape, taking hundreds of schoolgirls as slaves... they justified anything world can throw at them at this point already. 

there is a you tube video, where a guy in the USA builds a tank from bulldozer and goes on rampage in a small town for a quite a while, until he got stuck and committed a suicide inside it. you can see swat teams running around, trying to do him some harm but to no avail.

watching that video i understood just how local police forces aren't equipped to deal with these kind of situations. OK, daesh won't land with tanks, but ""mere"" hundred people armed with automatic weapons, RPGs and with combat experience (can't emphasize enough how important this is) pose a huge danger to civil systems of any european country. hell, how many terrorists were in mumbai? these weren't seasoned soldiers, they were lightly armed - and how long did the attack last? IMO it would be perilous to ignore the threat and i sure hope italians won't."

in my experience - you don't want serrated blade on your fixed blade knife for number of reasons. also, when you are buying a knife - buy a blade, don't buy compasses, snares and stuff - you can either make that yourself or buy them as a separate items."

srbistan,"you mean it's not just measuring tool often used in scientific community to put things in a proper scale?! i can actually eat it??? damn i gotta try this, thanks man!"
srbistan,"excuse me - five of what, years or months? puppy class you mentioned confused me, so i'm unsure. if it's five years (as i presume), than it's fully grown and formed dog, challenging task even for an experienced handler/carer. is it pure bred or mixed - generally, what kind of dog is it (a pic would answer few questions i have...)?

first thing i would do is to remove all of his toys and stuff (especially edible ones, such as pig ears), as dogs can get possessive, and give him toys only as a reward. as for defecating and urinating all over - try walking your dog some half an hour after he has eaten until he defecates outside, and do not go back inside until he's done (once he does his stuff, praise him lavishly and go straight back home).

depending on the climate you're in you could do similar thing with water (be careful : dogs dehydrate FAST so it's maybe better to skip this if uncertain, but if you opt to try - dog MUST have water given to him every 45 - 60 minutes. if he doesn't drink, that's fine, wait for next turn).

as for your boyfriend, you can do the following : take your dog for a walk, hold the leash. dog should be on your left, boyfriend on your right. just a casual walk in a calm surrounding, no distractions... leash should be long enough for your boyfriend to get a hold on it too. slow down one step, let your boyfriend get in the middle position, you take the right one and just carry on walking calmly as before. few rounds of that and you can go to next level - you stop, your boyfriend walks the dog few meters from you then turns back and comes back, gradually increasing the distance between you until he can do it on his own. do this outside, as dogs tend to react very differently when inside their home.

dog on dog aggression is way too common, but it's not the priority - for the time being keep your dog on a leash at all times.

now i must ask - what would happen if you were to take the dog back (trying to figure out how important is to fix the problem, as returning the dog might be a simpler option)? 

also, no matter what some people are telling you there are enough willing to help, so fuck haters - you try and that's the only thing that counts. adopting a dog is noble and good thing to do in the first place."
srbistan,"well squirrel is mostly herbivorous, while racoon is omnivorous and presumably a carrion eater. so, logic would dictate : squirrel is OK if you have nothing better, but it's better to avoid racoon meat. 

btw you can follow a squirrel in the woods to her hiding place which would usually be full of edible nuts. if you do that during the winter or late in the fall squirrel probably starves, so don't do it just for fun - it's a survival technique. "
srbistan,"i think tzar tank from WWI takes the first prize as the most absurd tank ever built, but i didn't know it had such fierce competition."

srbistan,it definitely captures the spirit. awesome hack!
srbistan,"thanks for taking time to reply, but i'm still not convinced, and you really shouldn't care about it. enjoy (and i mean it) :)"
srbistan,"i adopted a scared dog too, so i gradually raised her tolerance to things she was being scared of (and it worked).

for instance - she was scared of being hit/kicked, so i would start playing with her and petting her (sort of tickling game) and when she would relax enough i would start hitting my hand (one i'm petting her with) with my other hand, to make clapping noise while using calming or playful voice. 
gradually i would relax the hand i'm petting her with, so some of impact force would come through, but mindful it doesn't scare or interrupt pleasant experience of playing. if i notice her reacting bad i would stop and just carry on with ""tickling"" and funny voices. 

or i would play with her (sitting down, ground level) and push her (gently, of course) with my leg. gradually making that movement more and more alike to actually kicking her (not in terms of force, but to make it look like that). 

i would show her a treat and would push her off gently at first (again - gradually increasing the force, careful not to scare her) to the point she would ignore the ""threat"" and wiggle to get the treat. this plays on similar mechanism as the ""choking off"" with working dogs.

if your dog has issues with noise - pick a source of noise loud enough to scare your dog (gun range, railway tracks, tram line...) and play with your dog nearby. exact distance from a noise source is relative to dog, start at the point where you see your dog feeling uncomfortable, but not too scared. gradually close in to the source of noise. when you see your dog starts to ""panic"" - that's the place you'll be spending time playing untill he gets accustomed to the noise level. this may take days or months, but it works. 

if you decide to do this - have your dog on a leash, to prevent possibility of him running away scared. if your dog is ""eater"" reinforce play with treats and always use calming or playful voice (whatever works better).

before shitstorm begins i must say i LOVE my dog and i would never hurt her, no matter how crazy what i wrote sounds, but my poor english limits my ability to explain things more subtle and in greater details.

edit : naturally - time is essential factor, but i presumed you are well aware of that, as an experienced dog carer."
srbistan,"USSR had no significant influence over ""that part of europe"", and YU was not part of the warsaw pact, so entire heartbreaking story is most likely utter BS (i would pay attention to his user name which reads ""TROLLington""). YU was very, very different to all other socialist countries in eastern and southeastern europe in many aspects (illustrative fact : the only country ever that fought US and had McDonalds on it's territory).

also, there is no such thing as ""slavic"" language (there is a linguistic group of slavic languages, though, but that's scientific, not colloquial, term) - croats speak croatian, serbs serbian, and so on. one more thing - there are no ""bosniaks"", those people are bosnian muslims, descendents from local population islamized during the ottoman rule.

i had a situation where (semi) aggressive rotweiler bitch ran after a lady with a child coming out of the woods in a local park and my (otherwise ultra-friendly and kid loving) dog, also rottie, just took off after them too, like he has done it hundred times before. stopped them both, no harm done, but lesson well learned. i suppose the cat lost her life in similar scenario.

srbistan,why? because - you stop him!
srbistan,"those ""C shaped things"" are called ""otsilla"" and placed like that, are byzant symbol for christianity (they form a cross between them), part of serbian coat of arms since the year of 1402. IRL otsillo is iron for starting fire using flint... symbolic meaning is something along lines ""spark of christianity"".

individual sign itself also reads as letter ""S"" in serbian, thus four ""C shaped things"" mean ""only unity saves serbs"" (all those words begin with letter S in serbian language)."
srbistan,"under the international law, genocide actually has very wide definition, under which more or less any oppression falls under.

what i'm trying to tell you (illustrated with those couple of hundreds of thousands of live examples) that it is not the ""mindframe of victim"" but harsh reality. as someone who lived through things you are so casual to put in one sentence i can tell you you don't have a clue about balkans history, nor local demographics.

CNN&amp;FOX aren't exactly a tool for a historian, nor they are credible sources. they are more of propaganda tool, and info gained from similar sources should be treated as such. one thing you are right though, i am emotional about people not having a slightest clue about what really happened giving themselves a moral right to explain situation to others."
srbistan,"if you believe only one side commits war crimes in a civil war you are very wrong.

as for ""historical mindset of a victim"" : in 1995. between 150.000 -300.000 serbian people were forced from croatia, only insignificant number returned after the war due to numerous pressures from croatian authorities.  how do you call that if not genocide? it's noteworthy that there is [annual mass given in capital of croatia for fascist leader ante pavelic](http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=8776547&amp;ct=14419347), one responsible for hundreds of thousands civilian victims during WW2.

in 1999. 200.000 serbian people had to flee from kosovo, after NATO helped albanians drive them off. how come that isn't a genocide too?

btw - only in one croatian concentration camp - notorious jasenovac were killed more far more people than number 500.000 you are mentioning, and there were number of other places of mass destruction."

srbistan,"i know this must be hard for you but listen up : idea of giving the dog to a dog security company is actually from personal experience. a lady came to a company i used to work for with gorgeous, healthy, long haired german shepherd about a year old. she told us she wants him retrained as he is aggressive, dangerous liability. she even had poor dog neutered thinking it will make him less aggressive. 

my boss and i held the dog for a day or two and then told her it's ""beyond repair"" for money she was willing to invest, but we're eager to take her of her hands. dog was just a bit on the sharp side, nothing too serious. needless to say, dog got all the care, love and exercise such magnificent animal deserves - it was a proper happy ending of what was bound to end as a tragedy. i truly wish your dog the same fate, reputable companies mostly respect and care for dogs as they are source of their livelihood."
srbistan,must've lost something in that truck if he was running that fast.
srbistan,"two years is not too old to retrain and get a reliable dog as a result. unfortunately, given the family photo (please don't take it as offense, i really appreciate your honesty on this one, but this is a relevant fact)  you would do best to ""lose"" the dog to a professional guard dogs company, where that level of aggression could be tapped and controlled, maybe even considered as an asset.

by no means do not try to keep the dog! rottweilers are LETHAL to unarmed humans if they chose to be. there is no need to put the dog down, there is still chance to home him nicely, but (once again, my apologies for saying so) your father is putting your family in grave danger. try to reason with him or make an arrangement and ""lose"" your dog."

srbistan,"or a PR agency pulling of some really nifty viral marketing using ""laid off staff"" as MIM attack medium... anything looks more realistic than country whose Internet  infrastructure collapses twice a week. just sayin' "
srbistan,"often people ask similar question here. while dementia is one possibility it needn't be the case. sensory failure is evolutionary death sentence in K9s (in short : wolf who can't hunt - starves, end of story). i suppose it's been genetically coded and dogs with failing sensory perception tend to be unsure and/or try to mask their diminishing capabilities, which results in strange behaviour, something we read as ""being elderly asshole"".

what you want is your young, full of strength and life energy dog back, but sorry - no can do. that IS your dog, it's late phase in her life, enjoy your friendship... things you can do : give her lighter food, shorten the walks and exercises try not to expose her to too much stress of any kind. in a word - take care of the old lady :)  "
srbistan,"while in the army we had 4 pairs in our ""combat pack"" (it's like ammo, bombs, socks, underwear and a loaf of bread sized back-pack). i would carry even more now. i don't think you omitted socks, just a friendly reminder :)"
srbistan,"your question was totally in place, eyesight test can be preformed without a vet (it's not like you are getting a prescription glasses for your dog and you need exact diopter...), i'm sorry i haven't seen your question earlier, but /u/cuntbun explained the process. i'll just repeat it : cover one eye, make motion like you are going to hit the dog in the one uncovered. natural reaction is for dog to jerk a bit. cover the other eye - repeat the process... dog can feel the draft from your incoming palm, so you should stop hand some 20-30 cm away from dog's face. if your dog lost his eyesight suddenly - then it's time to check with vet.

similar is with hearing - cover dog's eyes (so it doesn't react on motion but on sound) and snap fingers closer and closer to your dog's head, observe reaction. 

there are lots of ""smartest loonies in the world"" owning a dog and sometimes i get the feeling they all aggregate here on /r/dogs. of course there are also people ""my dog is vomiting blood what shall i do?"", which is truly saddening, but your question was perfectly reasonable attempt to avoid paying for simple piece of advice IMO."
srbistan,"there is one crucial thing often overlooked : cotton socks! if you're walking/working expect to use 1-2 per day. you can go on smelly for days (referring to Tshirts&amp;underwear), but you can't go on for a long time with blisters and feet infection. you can also tuck stuff inside socks, effectively using them as a compartments for easier management."
srbistan,do you regret not wearing thongs now?
srbistan,"oh yes you can reinforce fearful reaction. you need to take dog's attention from it, by playing with him or doing something similar (different dogs react to different kind of distractions)."
srbistan,"if dog chewed on blanket and carpet he/she could've as easily chewed a power cord or something else harmful. if it wasn't a voluntary dog sitting (friend or family whom you don't want piss off) it is you who should be mad, as the  person who was payed to watch over your dog didn't do that. i know i would be mad as hell. 

that is one pretty careless dog handler we're talking about and if there is a rating system (ie. website you found dog carer) i think you should rate that carer very negative."
srbistan,"any man who runs away and leaves his army behind is by no means great, regardless of his earlier or later military (or other) successes."

srbistan,"thanks OP, that's good thing to know! i'll tag along with something similar : 

if you peel that first layer of wood just beneath the bark from a pine tree rich in sap (15-20cm length, ~5 mm thick strips) and make dense comb like incisions on one side you can light up that side easily and it will burn slowly and for quite long time, regardless of how wet it is.
few of these ""candles"" can warm you up in a tent on a rainy night, provided you have dry clothes (learning this was miserable experience).

this is an emergency solution, as it damages a tree, avoid using it if possible. if you really have to do it pay attention to take strips from several trees, in order to avoid destroying one if you peel off too much of it's protective bark."

on more personal level : not long ago my mother had to go to an emergency clinic and as we had to wait for hours i went out to have a smoke. i saw a scrawny looking bloke sitting under a tree and he asked me for a smoke. i give him one and we start talking, but soon i realized he is talking total nonsense, occasionally saying something with perfect clarity - like a bugged computer. i managed to get it out of him that he is a construction worker and he got hit on a building site on head with something today and he is still waiting to be admitted and has completely lost his track of time (it was around midnight and he mentioned he will be late for 15:00 bus to his hometown).
so i go to the nurse on a reception and tell her about a guy who is either bat shit crazy or has some serious problem and then went back to my mom. few minutes later i saw whitecoats rushing the guy on a hospital wheel-bed into surgery. i heard one of nurses saying he has a brain swelling (not sure what it's called in english) and they need to operate immediately or he is a goner... my mom was OK, thankfully, so i think His Noodly Appendage put us there to save him that night (it would be far fetched to thank darwin for that). i prevented natural selection on two more occasions i can remember, but can't be bothered to write about it, no one ever reads these long runts anyhow."

srbistan,"i believe you are wishing well and thank you for your constructive reply. respectfully, i simply can't argue anymore about this, so this is my final post on the matter.

concept of emulating dog's behaviour does not include me going on my four, barking and humping a dog to establish a dominance - it's far, far more than that and what you wrote is, at best, oversimplification. instead i try to incorporate some elements of dog to dog behaviour in order to try to minimize the gap in communication between two species. 

alpha unit concept is very true and it's been tried and tested (something you notice when you get to train other handlers and analyze why some are successful where others are not). you need to understand that commercial dog training is highly competitive business, where a lot of people put their profit and prestige before dog's well being in the long run. nobody wants to see his dog ""suffer"", and (some of) pet dog trainers will abuse that fact as a competitive edge against ""those old school, outdated, horrible, cruel, retard"" dog trainers. and let me tell you - dogs haven't evolved that much in the last few decades.

one of trainers i had honour and pleasure of working with once said ""there is no wrong way of training a dog IF the dog is doing what he should be doing and there is not too much stress in it for him"". implying - some stress is mandatory, but let me remind you of your school days - it wasn't all milk and honey.

i've seen numerous dogs put down, run over by cars and lost because their handlers/carers were blatantly lied to by trainers employing ""modern techniques"" that they are getting a RELIABLE dog. i've rescued, retrained and rehomed some of ""death row"" dogs and i know very well what i'm talking about. there is not a slightest doubt in my mind i'm doing things mostly right (dog watching - you SEE if your dog is unpleased and stressed and change/adjust method). i say mostly as dogs are individuals and when working with individuals you are bound to make an occasional error, trick is not to be hardheaded about it.

a little illustration here : i'm currently living with a small stray dog i took off the street about a year ago. when i saw her first she was too scared to take food from my hand, now she boldly approaches strangers asking to be patted and plays with other dogs in the park. if i told you how i did it you would probably call me crazy (no force could be used as she was to scared), but it worked - which is good enough for me.

finally - this is just my take on the question OP asked. i know i would like to hear as much different opinions rooted in logic when i begun working with dogs.

edit: races 2 species"
srbistan,"i've been training and handling dogs for some 20 years now, both working dogs (guard dogs and sniffer dogs) and pets. dog welfare was always my prime concern and all of my dogs lead long and happy lives. dogs aren't human babies, no matter how much some people want them to be. what and how i teach dogs is a result of watching dogs behaviour in dog packs and ""some"" serious learning from the best trainers around. what we (humans) may perceive as a ""violence"" is a mere way of communication between them and thus comes normal.

a very good trainer, highly successful and famous around the world in his field of work (i'll omit the name this time) once described his technique as ""no nonsense"", and it's exactly that. besides, checking and ""punishing"" dog AREN'T same things and people tend to ""downvote"" what they don't understand but that is just a human nature. since english is my second language i may have made an error expressing myself, but i think it's quite clear i do not advocate violence towards animals.

for instance - i want my dogs to stop what they are doing immediately when i tell them, as (just) one mistake can lead to dog running into a traffic or nipping a paranoid person who would report you to the police, which may result in a loss of a dog's life, which is unacceptable. dogs lives are far more important to me than ""political correctness"". 

checking a dog is something bitches do to their pups from earliest stages of growing up. if you do it correctly and carefully - it's both natural for them and beneficial in the future."
srbistan,"get a [check chain collar ](http://shared1.ad-lister.co.uk/UserImages/84ecf7fa-32e7-427c-9c68-773615271e39/Img/winners/winnwersd-017.jpg) and whenever your dog does something undesired - use it (each time you do so say the word you will be using in the future ie. ""NO""). the idea isn't to physically punish your dog with a check chain, but to cause discomfort (check chain is a simple and effective tool, but you need to know what to do with it - read about it before you use it) and link it to the word ""no"". in time it will be enough just to say the word.

your dog is VERY young, and  still clueless about the world around her. things you listed are just part of growing up process, nipping, chowing or even biting in that age can be expected as they change their teeth and it's annoying as hell for them (they are trying to scratch their gums but are still unsure of their jaws strength and their teeth sharpness).

i would expect strong hunting/predatory drive a hound-beagle mix, so i would recommend to keep an eye on that. socialize your dog with same sex dogs as much as possible."
srbistan,"ear stretching?! damn i'm out of date, people used to take corrective surgery to fix that... "

srbistan,"to be able to do that you need to power your computer and it's screen (even if it's a laptop). if you can do that - all is well and you don't need a kobo as a tool, nor R-pi.

i'm talking about permanent (this is arguable) source of knowledge when you can't access your public library."
srbistan,"not sure what you had in mind, but for a lasting digital library you would probably be better off with ""kobo"" e reader and bunch of memory cards preloaded with literature you need/want. would say kindle, but it needs computer (or network) to be loaded with new books, as it doesn't have an SD slot.

you could build something similar from R-Pi, but i doubt you could match low power consumption."
srbistan,"left one knows shitstorm is coming, but YOLO!"
srbistan,"you should use eco friendly, low energy consumption lighting bulbs and risk fungal infections, you should eat bugs instead of cows, as there is not enough water... well FUCK NO! 

""they"" should build less tanks, warplanes, bombs, missiles, test less rockets, explode fewer ordinances, occupy less land and pollute it for good and (oh wonder!) there would be enough beef to go around for anybody who wants to eat it.

this hypocrisy makes me mad! half of world's resources are wasted on attempts to kill each other or scare each other into obedience, and someone is trying to convince me that my meal is the problem!

srbistan,"roger, will look into it more closely (don't have time to do it today). sometimes logic, i'm so keen to utilize, does not apply to the real world, especially when power and money are involved."
srbistan,"i did, thanks. the only credible source (on the first glance, i'll check more thoroughly later on) is the time website's article, which is mostly based on the same sources as that huff post article.

""setting free by killing... "" that is just so crazy i find it hard to believe, and that is why i'm asking all these questions - out of disbelief. peta exists for a long time now, how come they kept this hidden for so long? ok it's possible, but all those volunteers (say - naive people, like me), someone would surely provide sufficient evidence for criminal charges (am i wrong to assume killing animals is criminal offense in most US states?)."
srbistan,"&gt; What would someone gain from slandering an animal ""charity"" anyways?

i copied part of my answer to another person here in case you miss it:

as far as i understood - peta is pain in the ass for companies testing products on animals, and it's realistic scenario that those companies hire PR services to bad mouth them. IMO far more realistic than they (peta) are killing animals ""en masse"" for a decade without anybody doing anything to stop it.

i'm strongly against testing cosmetic products on animals (meds are OK, but cosmetics - big time NO), and i can understand someone burning/bombing these places.

my question is - why would someone who risks terrorism charges kill those same animals they are trying to save/ protect/whatever (i'm not being smart, this is genuine question about motives)?"
srbistan,"thank you for your reply, yes i am genuinely interested, but i'm also very, very skeptical that thing like that could go on for such a long time. 

i checked website you linked to, and found following :

link to [VDACS](http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/animals/pdf/allentities.pdf) doesn't mention peta even once. when you search this website for the keyword peta - nothing comes out, so things are NOT so clear. btw that report is dated 2003. - eleven years ago.

links from ""media"" section of petakills.com website are ALL broken (but few youtube videos). what is more whois lookup doesn't yield any results on who the website registrant is. being aware that Internet is soap box of choice for all kind of loonies makes me suspicious and i like to double check info.

i'm not expecting you to do the search for me, i'll take a better look at peta activities for myself, but as far as i understood - peta is pain in the ass for companies testing products on animals, and it's realistic scenario that those companies hire PR services to bad mouth them. IMO far more realistic than they (peta) are killing animals ""en masse"" for a decade without anybody doing anything to stop it.

once more, thanks for a polite reply, i hope truth about this will come out in the open."
srbistan,"strange, reddit still says 20 days. even stranger - you don't provide any links, but instead insist on one single case, based on one man's claim.

from what i understand peta is US version of RSPCA of UK, something i'm bit more familiar with and i would be VERY surprised they are just a bunch of dog killing loonies, as portrayed by the respectable huff post. it IS possible, but highly unlikely. i mean - why, and how do you trick so many people (hundreds or thousands - correct me if i'm wrong) volunteering there into doing stuff like that? how come none of them came out to testify about systematic abuse of animals?

now i shall end this futile conversation, as it leads nowhere. however i'll check tomorrow morning for possible peta wrongdoing. in case someone can provide some credible links and shorten my search - please do so. i'm NOT defending peta, i'm questioning everything i see and hear, text (from huff post) in question included."
srbistan,"ok redditor for 20 days, sorry for the rude answer, but your question wasn't much better either. as i said (twice) - i'm not familiar with peta operations (i've never even been to the US), but last time i read post similar to this it was debunked as a blatant lie. 

please provide few credible links to support what you are saying. in case this text is true you have my deepest and sincerest apology. i would never support any cause harmful to animals as one described here, i merely tried to apply some logic to this issue."
srbistan,"oh yes you do. and it awaits you, whole 2 meters of it (six feet for those with colonial fetish)..."
srbistan,so they don't teach reading where you went to school?
srbistan,maybe you should reconsider that title OP... i don't think it means what you think it means.
srbistan,"i remember last time when peta got trashed here on reddit people found out that ""reliable source of info"" was in fact a website made by a PR or lobby group notorious for lying and slender. i'm not an american so i really don't remember which group/company was it , nor i know much about peta practice, but since this is the second ""anti-peta"" post today i'm a bit suspicious. 

i took a closer look at the article before i posted this : 
first two links are from the same website (one guy on a crusade), third returns error 403 - forbidden, next two are dated from 2007. and 2005. respectively. remainder of links in the text are pretty much along this line and from same sources. this, coupled with huff post reputation are huge warning signs for me.

i'll repeat - i'm not american and don't know shit about peta, apart from what i've heard (animal rescue and so on) but i find it strange there aren't more similar stories out there for huff to quote, especially since peta uses volunteers in it's shelters. i know i would react if i were to see something like mass murder of animals by organization i'm volunteering."

if multiple bites or ""true bite"" please consult a behaviorist before you make any irrevocable decision. if there is one at all maybe that problem is correctable.

your mom probably surprised the dog while he was in full frenzy of an ""defense drive"" (google this). lesson learned - NEVER approach agitated dog from a blind spot. you should also work on calming your dog on command (IMO dogs jumping at fences are just asking for pepper spray in their face). you should reinforce basic obedience routine with your mother as a handler. realization she is in full control of the dog will break her fear and you will see how dog reacts on her, which should give you clear picture on what to do.

that is correct, we have ridiculously harsh weapon laws where i live (swords, bows and arrows included), yet we're second only to america in terms of number of guns per capita. making guns illegal doesn't do jack shit - people always find a way to fuck each other up when they want to.

intimidation laws? haven't heard of these before. how do you define ""intimidate"" when some people are intimidated by sheer presence of people with guns? how does one prove ""he/she put hand on a holster and looked at me threateningly""? do they (laws) work IRL? thanks."

dogs are animals, meaning they are not ""doggies"" but ""canis lupus"", and although they are ""C.L. familiaris""  - there is no reasoning with them in human terms. even the smallest, most harmless dog can intimidate or scare someone for life unless handled properly. not to mention ignoring the handler and getting run over by a car, which is my prime concern, TBH. thus - effective training is of ultimate importance, even for a household pet, second only to handlers education.

if you carefully observe a pack of dogs (or many packs of dogs) you'll notice that physical ""punishment"" is part of everyday communication in a pack, which follows a dog from earliest life till the very end. applied properly (i prefer calling it ""checking"" or ""correction"") is far better method of passing a message to a dog than confusing animal with over-humanized version of training. applying a physical punishment properly is far complicated then it sounds it means you are halfway to understanding canine nonverbal communication, which is really, really rare in my experience."

srbistan,[i think i've found a solution for us](http://buygoldinfo.com/images/largest-gold-coin.jpg)
srbistan,"dog's nails ""shorten themselves"" when your dog walks enough, resulting in traction of nails against ground surface. fact that you don't need to shorten your dog's nails using clipper tells some nice things about you as a handler :)

rate at which this happens varies and is related to terrain (concrete/tarmac VS grass in a park/open field - concrete is ""better manicure"").
as the dog gets older (much older) and his/her walks shorten nails will start to show and at one point you will surely have to clip them off. it is not a bad idea to accustom your dog to the process by shortening a nail or two occasionally. 
as that ""side toe nail"" (not sure what it's called in english, sorry) gets no traction with the ground it needs to be clipped from time to time, as it may grow enough to get entangled in stuff and cause an injury to dog.

i had dogs ""biting nails"" but after close observation i concluded they were only cleaning or scratching themselves, not actually biting nails the way people do. however, i've also seen dogs doing this when their nails are too long and start curving on the inside of a paw (which i suppose isn't pleasant feeling) - info superfluous to any decent dog handler/carer."

still it would be great if ruskies could get freely into NK, as we (reads: I) could finaly get some proper info on what's going on there. unless NK decided to start opening up, chances of this deal going through are slim, as NK is probably aware that tons of russians are going to swarm their country, out of curiosity if nothing else. 
i'm not in illusion people there are living great, but judging by technological level occasionally shown by NK i can't picture it as a place where meth abuse is a common hospitality ritual and people are eating each other.

i was born behind ""the curtain"", and am aware of what most of the west thought we were, while we were something different in reality. my country was very liberal compared to other commie states (we weren't part of warsaw pact), so we had western produced media, tv shows and arts - uncensored. it was funny to see how we were portrayed in popular culture. i suppose it was due to lack of info paired with a bit of malicious cold war propaganda, which is exactly like with NK now days. possibly they are quite normal society (in commie terms) one could agree with. common denominator for all commie states was free education, which includes higher education, tech schools and such, and i know it's possible to have sugar and cooking oil outage and still have ""normal"" society. normal in terms of being able to integrate in wider world society, given chance."

srbistan,"there is no such thing as a quiet (internal combustion) motor boat on the river.

besides, where you have bunkers you usually have observers and sentry nearby so firing a flaming object from a distance less then 100m makes you very visible and seems very close to a suicide.

however - it is logical to asume that they (army) wouldn't be giving dogs to civilian population if that was the case. 

as for dog2dog aggression, military dogs are usually held in kennels with other dogs (each has it's own box, but one roof), have daily contact with other dogs, and are trained in groups. besides army trained dogs are too expensive (from army's perspective) to be allowed to inflict damage to each other even unleashed, so you should be OK regarding this issue.

srbistan,"even if you have the kindest and ""softest"" dog in the world - that is not how most people (especially parents) percieve german shepherds and IMO there is the biggest problem with GSD serving as therapy dog."
srbistan,"dog training differs from army to army, but in army i served with most dogs are allergic (very, very mildly put) to anything not wearing uniform. dogs CAN be socialized, almost regardless of their age, but if you have small children maybe you should reconsider.

in my XP with military trained dogs conflicts with other animals (your dogs ie.) are the least of your worries, for number of reasons. their reaction to other people is another matter. i'm talking about guard dogs, but there are also sniffer dogs, which aren't that dangerous. 

i asume you are talking about US army ex service dog, and i wouldn't comment if any US army handler responded, as none of what i said may be truth, but since nobody said anything i felt compelled to tell opinion based on personal experience. maybe you should repost this question on one of US military subreddits."

i've seen with my own eyes things we are talking about now. US administration(s) aren't backing up rebels because they are the good guys, as you can clearly see from examples of lybia, iraq afghanistan or saudi arabia, but because it's good for business.

srbistan,"dog handler (i do not own my dog, she's my friend, thus i'm not an owner, but a handler) must have his priorities straight. priority one : YOU!
there are number of reasons for this, here is just one : if you are both hurt there is nobody to take your dog to the vet's while you are being treated your dog might perish from wounds (i know this might sound over exaggerated but i try to prepare for the worst case ontario, so everything else is easier to deal with). i'm insisting on this as if you inflict pain on a dog in frenzied state it might turn on you. please, please, please have this in mind and never let your love for your dog put you both in jeopardy. i realize it is very hard and unpleasant even to think about it, but IMHO one must be ready for hardest choices before they come to be.

it takes surprisingly much strength and skill do disable any dog that poses a serious threat. if you are frail, as you say, always consider avoiding confrontation as a first option. spotting a troublesome situation before it happens is the best thing you could do - do not listen to music on your earpiece(most dogs vocalize prior or during the attack), do not immerse yourself in conversation with your (human) friend, ignore the politeness of looking people in the face while you are talking to them - always look around you and be vigil. this is not a paranoia, it's common sense. level of vigilance is determined by your previous expirience in the area, naturally.

unfortunately i don't have a particular advice for frail people other then what i've already said, nor i think there is one. what you could do if you see an attack is imminent - take of your jacket, shirt or whatever you are wearing as a top and roll it as tightly as possible on your OFF arm (left if you write with your right - i'm not sure if ""off arm"" is a legit expression)  - this is the part of your body you will be ""serving"" to an attacking animal while you pound it as hard as you can in nose with ASP baton. hitting any really dangerous dog on a scull with an ASP won't do much ""good"" unless you can really pack a punch. cover your hand too! try to get a dog to bite the arm, as hand is full of small bones and dog can apply less pressure with jaws opened wider than it could with jaws more closed. there is a fast and fluid move where you take off one of your sleeves, snap the jacket as a whip (on hand that has sleeve left on it) and roll it on your arm by waving your arm in circular motion, not bad to know...

please read ""important edit"" of my original reply to the thread about patent umbrella, i added it after your post - thank you for reminding me. also sorry for the delay in answering but as i'm non native english speaker it takes me quite some time and effort to write more or less meaningful advice about these things, that wouldn't put people in risk if applied. i hope you will never, ever need it though."
srbistan,"i understand your point, but i thought i made it clear this isn't one of those ""those damn blood thirsty monsters"" rants. i used expression ""fighting terriers"" to save myself few lines of listing dog breeds - nothing more. 

i do stand by what i said - dogs i mentioned have specific way they shaking the prey (short violent shakes induce horrible damage).  that differs from, for example, rottweiler attack (which are my personal favorite but only second to ""fighting terriers"" in terms of what i consider greatest reasonable threat) which would make large shakes and limit their damage to fewer places. i've seen smaller dogs being shaken by rottweilers like rag dolls and ending up relatively unhurt - that doesn't happen with fighting terriers."

srbistan,"i completely agree, i just didn't want to see well meaning and possibly useful advice being dismissed as a sadistic tirade, as it sometimes happen on doggit."
srbistan,"where i live tasers are very illegal, besides i think electric current would hurt both dogs if they are in physical contact (saliva reduces specific resistance and so on..). 
there are models that could be fired from a distance, but in what is usually a chaotic situation i would doubt steadiness of my hand with only one shot. just an oppinion, i don't know enough about it to give you an advice."

srbistan,you haven't met my neighbours... 
srbistan,"first of all if you have dog small enough, and given enough time - climb the hood of a nearest car, use your feet to keep attacking dog on lower grounds. untrained dogs rarely go for the prey above their eyes level and paying for the eventual car damage is way better than physical injury to your dog.

i always carry ASP baton while walking my dog. i have a small female mutt, a frightened poor excuse for a dog but a part of the family so any assailant need to go through me to get her. recently a huge russian hound attacked her so i had to intervene (i opted to try to fend him off knowing russian hounds seldom go for humans. luckily one blow was enough to make him run away. attacking dog was not injured, mine was only bitten. word of advice : do not pay attention to human reactions - if you think there is going to be trouble get the baton ready ASAP, you can easily put it away if A-OK i waited a split second too long, hoping other dog won't attack. 

you have two options with an ASP baton - try to scare/fend off the attacking dog or try to kill it.  if you want to fend the dog off (keep in mind it may turn on you and if other handler can't help you, you could end up seriously hurt) hit the chest or hind legs from the side. in live or die situationa turn the asp the other way around (open ASP and grab the point, handle - heavier part further from yourself) - aim for the spine between the front and hind legs where the spine is in longest straight line. 

there is one more thing one could do, but it could be extremely dangerous if you aren't strong and agile. grab atacking dog hind legs and hold them up in the air. when you hold dog's hind legs in the air he looses the leverage needed to inflict damage from shaking. keep in mind you will need to let go at one time and dog won't exactly stand still, but will jump, wiggle and try to grab you!

if a fighting terrier (pit/staff/bull...) grabs and locks into your dog it is IMPERATIVE to prevent him from shaking. you can do that hold him by the neck(collar if there is one, if none you could try using your leash as a noose) to stop him from shaking as this inflicts most damage, but be very, very careful. ALWAYS have your (off hand) between dog's jaws and your face/neck, never leave this path clear in conflict situations. kicking usually won't do, what is more it will just anger the other dog.

source: i was military and private security handler and it's fairly common for trash to try stopping a patrolman with a dog by loosing a pit bull or something similar on our dogs, so we had to be prepared.

important notes: 
1: i'm aware all this sounds brutal, and it is - dog fight is an ugly affair. believe me i would never hurt a dog unless left without alternative, but those things happen and it's better to be prepared, ot least have an idea what to do, then sorry IMO.
2: i have nothing against fighting terriers and i have known some very lovable ones, but the truth is they are the most dangerous and common in these situations.
3: knife involves close contact and kill, both of which you want to avoid. carrying a gun for a dog walk is an option, but a dog walk shoud be a pleasure not a paranoid manifestation, besides it's extremely hard to hit such a small and fast moving target such as dog and the risk of shooting your own dog is just too big.
4: pepper spray only simply isn't reliable enough, but is still better then nothing, especially for frail and elderly people.

sorry for the lengthy answer and i hope people will understand it as it was meant - as a help, not as an instruction on how to hurt a dog.

IMPORTANT EDIT:

i feel like a moron for not saying this first, but patent umbrellas scare the living daylight out of most dogs - just open it in their faces. (you can try it on your own dogs just to see the effect, but i'm telling you - it'll run scare him VERY MUCH, maybe you shouldn't do it out of sheer curiousity. i did it once as i didn't believe it will work on my ""i rule the world"" fully trained rottweiler. after seeing the result we trained all our guard dogs for a damn umbrella situation!)."

srbistan,"from my own experience, you can always limit dog's movement by closing few doors where you don't want him to go (considering dog wrecking things), and move the stuff that might end up chewed there, or put it on higher grounds (and that is only for the time being, until the dog gets trained and accustomed, anyway). i believe that's still better than keeping the dog in a crate. think if you had to sentence a human to spend your away from home hours in a solitary confinement, which is equivalent of space, stimuli and entertainment of a crate in human terms.

it must be said that leaving two dogs (you are not completely familiar with, and which are old enough to cause serious injuries to each other) unattended can be dangerous, and one shouldn't do that before is sure dogs get along fine. crating until you are sure stands to the reason.

yes there is training, but a behaviour pattern you impose on a dog matters more then a particular training. for instance ""no playing in the house"" policy is a good idea : no running in the house, and nothing besides dog's toys and food given to him is ever permitted in his mouth (teach your dog NO command and whenever he tries to grab anything other then his toys he gets firm NO).

scenario : dog finds a slipper(any other object) and starts chewing on it. handler commands LEAVE (means : drop, let go whatever you are holding in your mouth - this is a ""negative"" command) and rests, not looking straight at a dog (do not praise dog after ""negative"" command, your calmness as opposed to ""violence"" of your negative command is enough of reinforcement). slipper stays where it is, and if dog tries again he gets NO, until he figures it out. if vocal command isn't working move on to step 2 - check chain. no tugging over the object, no shouting, just firm NO and if you are consistent in your attitude that's it - your computer is now safer with the dog around then without it :) .
important thing to know (general rule, thus prone to the exceptions) is that there is no such thing as ""sometimes"" or ""occasionally"" with dogs, it's either allowed  or not.

you could also follow your new dog around the house - if he shows too much interest in something that might fall over or break - it becomes a NO item. allow dog to examine whatever he wants though, as the opposite might wake his curiosity, but say NO when he gets to ""touchy"", ""bitey"" or close. maybe you could get your new dog on friday, so you could have a at least a weekend to get to know him."
srbistan,"to reduce risk of fights between dogs - get a dog of opposite sex to your chihuahua, if possible.

arrival of a new dog : DO NOT just enter the premises with the new dog (older one might feel threatened and react). instead introduce your old dog to your new dog during a walk (stage this). give them some time to socialize and start playing (or to get along, at least), and then - go to your home together. old dog comes in first, while on a leash, and make sure you give enough ""personal space"" for the new dog to enter. if the older dog reacts by growling or attacking a new one do not pet it - ""correct"" it (vocally or using check chain), this is very important! yeah, it's not ""choke chain"" - it's check chain if you do it right :). 

remove ALL toys for the first few days, introduce them gradually again - carefully observing ""possession issues"", whether one of your dogs is possessive to the point of defending a possession violently. if you leave them alone at home - remove all toys (again, until you meet them better). 

in my personal experience obedience training solves vast majority of dog behaviour problems (simple NO command should stop the dog doing whatever he is at the moment, ""hands munching"" included). what is more, a year old dog is still just a pup, plenty of time to shape it any way you want.

i completely agree about crating one dog, while other runs free - that is bound to create frustration. on crating in general : i've been handling all kinds of dogs for almost two decades now and can not justify, nor understand, dog crating. fair enough, there are some situations when it's needed, but it seems to me that people are mostly just too lazy to train their dogs to behave decently in a house/apartment.

things to do in advance : get one more bowl for food in advance, DO NOT feed the dogs from the same one. do not let one dog eat ""leftovers"" of the other dog's meal. hopefully this helps a bit, if there's anything in particular you would like to know - ask away, and best of luck with your new dog :)

people interested in dogs should be well aware that initial price of a dog is rather insignificant portion of money that will be spent on a dog during his first few years, and these expenses only rise towards dog's later phases of life (vet bills, special food and stuff...)."

srbistan,"dogs don't ""like"" the way people like, they get used to a new member of the pack in their sweet time (but with very few exceptions - they eventually do). some people are OK with dogs ""settling differences"" by themselves and establishing a pack order on their own, but i prefer to look closely dog's behavior and step in (as an alpha) every time i see one of the dogs is trying to impose dominance over the other. no ben, you can't take muffin's treat away I GAVE IT TO HIM, that kind of attitude - providing ben got the same treat already...

two separate bowls for food and water are a common sense in these situation, as well as a sign of my respect for dog's character (like people - some don't mind if you take a fry of their plate some lose their heads over it). don't let any of them in the bed until they're cool with each other (bed is super ""ego boost"" for dogs). teach them both same obedience techniques, they bond much better ""being in the same boat"", united by ""misery"" of having to obey.

srbistan,"it needs to be mentioned that healthy dogs take this posture usually when agitated or excited, playful or in anticipation.

older dogs who have problems getting up take this posture immediately before they rise as it strains their bodies least (leg muscles do the most lifting). to determine where exactly the dog feels pain make him stand up and then apply mild (but increasing) pressure using wide spread palms up to the point the dog starts to ""give way"" or shows signs of pain.
back leg area first, then front legs (usually it will be one of these) and then the middle part (do this VERY carefully). point is to know (approximately) how much force your dog could take earlier on, so you can tell if there is a decline or not, and where exactly as it might tell you where to look further.

depending on how long (in continuity) this happens it could be a sign of digestive tract disorder, but not very likely as there would probably be other symptoms. joint or muscle inflammation (caused by an air draft) can also cause pains similar to those in early stages of arthritis. when my late dog had pains (from time to time) i would give him mild painkiller. best bet are anal suppositories as they don't irritate dog's stomach the way pills do."

srbistan,"he was locally known as stevan filipovic and he was widely known national hero in former Yugoslavia. i went to the school by that name, and believe me (we've been force fed history for a good part of my younger days) he was executed in valjevo, which is in serbia - where conditions for an upraising against nazi occupation met, and where war begun and lasted until liberation. first territory free of german occupation in europe at that time was [uzice republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzice_Republic), western serbia. it was a short lived tragic dream really, but it explains a lot about national sentiments and in those days. after that there were some 5-6 great german offensives, there was a war going on in serbia, mongenegro and parts of bosnia full scale.

while germans [had their fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kragujevac_massacre) serbia was governed by occupational authorities and headed by one known as milan nedic who was mere german administrator without any  real power but to do harm and was widely perceived as such in serbia. 

during that time croatia was independent state ([how imaginative name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDH)) and a hard core nazi, with concentration camps for jews, gypsies and serbs, providing cannon fodder for ruskies in the east. 

chetniks were army of the king in exile, inherited by germans. there is a complicated controversy about them in serbia, but put simply - majority were collaborators during the war.

partisans, communists, were fighting against both germans and chetniks. they were mixed nationalities (many croats naturally) but predominantly serbian and montenegrin fighters, armies were formed there.

ustashe were official croatian army, [fucking SS in disguise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_persecution_of_Serbs#Usta.C5.A1e_persecution_in_the_Independent_State_of_Croatia),  they even took part in fights on russian eastern front.

srbistan,"more then 30% of all food made for western world ends up in a bin, inevitably entering the local ecosystem. there is no telling (proven beyond doubt for all GM products) what GM food does to the ecosystem once it gets into it (ie. GM soy which after shelf life has expired ends up as fertilizer).

srbistan,"it sounds like mild manifestation of separation anxiety. try following - when you leave for your trip, pet your dog shortly (no long, emotional goodbyes or soft talk), and do the same thing once you get back - just pet him to acknowledge you are glad to see him and YOU ignore him until he calms down (no playing, no emotional scenes on arrival). 

it seems obvious your dog's behavior is related to his handler (i tend to avoid a word ""owner"" for living creatures, except plants) being absent, and crucial moments in that scenario are leaving and coming back, so i would begin there. 

also, try ""switching on"" your dog by playing with him or doing some of the obedience exersize - that usually does the trick (do this few hours after you came back or any other ""regular"" day). be careful not to overtax his attention, dogs get fed up with games after a while too.

hope this helps and have a nice trip."

srbistan,"france had &gt;40 million of people before the war, vast majority of their military casualties were amongst colonial troops (senegalese and algerians aren't exactly french, they were just occupied by them). 
compare this to yugoslavia, country of 15 million people that lost up to 1.4 million people, civilian casualties only (some half of million combatants). 

as for comparison between US and france - US lost ~ 400.000 soldiers which is almost DOUBLE france did, and i'm damn sure they wouldn't let germans invade sitting on their bums, let alone conquer them as easily as french did.

point is - france surrendered instead of fighting germans. point is - they haven't even demolished their defensive structures. point is - they haven't fought for shit. point is - they supplied nazi armies with wine. point is - german soldiers thought of serving in france as a vacation. point is - compared to the rest of europe there was no real resistance movement in france, as they preferred to sit it out while others fight for their freedom. finally - compare photos of any east european city after WW2 to paris and you'll see the point for yourself.

srbistan,"first school of any kind in serbia was founded in 14-15 century and was called ""resava copy school"". it was part of monastery manasiya (AKA resava) where monks were hand copying books - both texts and illustrations. 

from what we've been thought in school monks often changed books while making copies, and story is that some were even illiterate and were only drawing signs instead of writing them. most of them learned and improved their skills and thus ""resava copy school"" is considered the first school in these parts.

there is a great book by turkish nobel laureate orhan pamuk ""my name is red"", about miniaturists in ottoman empire that could give you a ""feel"" what it was like if you are interested.

as for denial - serbia arrested and put to trial ALL accused of atrocities (inlcuding high ranking military officials and it's president at the time), while there are parts of bosnia now inhabited with arab popupulation and practicing sharia law. you have hundreds of thousands serbs expelled from croatia - and no one  even admited there is something wrong with that, let alone got convicted. NATO aggression on serbia begun because of alleged racak massacre - and only months after the war it was proven (by nato forensics) no mass graves ever existed there.

so either there is justice for all casualties or there is none at all and we're all just waiting for the second round. while war is hell, CIVIL war is bloodbath beyond understanding and logic."

tldr : fucking sheep"
srbistan,"evil russian empire also planned to activate nuclear bomb in a kindergarten located in downtown moscow and blame it on ukraine. they are also building a death star that would block sun to LA and play russian folk songs day and night until all gay of the world turn straight... not to mention putin-badgers, vicious animals trained to attack all those not singing russian anthem when the signal is given!

srbistan,"my grandfather told me this partisan's riddle from WW2 (sounds better in serbian, translation only serves to illustrate the popular sentiment about italian military within the ranks of one of it's adversaries during WW2) : 

it has a feather - yet it's not a bird, it has a rifle - yet it's not a soldier, it runs fast - yet it's not a rabbit, what is it? an italian soldier! 
(still can vividly remember my granddad laughing his ass off at the joke, in front of confused kid imagining a turkey with a gun and rabbit's ears, some 30-40 years after ww2).

other than that - once italy surrendered to the allies italians suffered greatly under the germans - mass executions, demolitions of public infrastructure (all the other charming nazi stuff going on, really...) and were generally treated like human trash, which probably generated some compassion for their people in the post war world.

tldr: italy as a fighting power is a laughing stock of the world, since the fall of the roman empire (and/or the death of vito corleone)."

srbistan,"first of all please bear in mind i do not wish to ridicule your taste in music, but as a local who grew up with this kind of music i can clearly tell the difference in quality between what is considered ""good"" and these warmongering folk-pop musicians... it's like comparing janis joplin and  Miley Cyrus in terms of good taste (ok it's a silly comparison, but i think you get the picture). 
as a fan of world music i often wish someone narrowed my search in particular music style, that is why i'm writing this, i fully respect you might like that particular style - quite a lot of people people do, it's just i like more ""root"" music.

brass band music should not have electronics (rhythm machines, synthetizers and such), and in general it has far complicated rhythm than ""oompah-pah"" you can hear in example you gave. there is a great festival of serbian brass music called ""sabor trubaca u guci"" (gucha trumpet festival) you could lookup on the U tube. try looking up for ""boban markovic orkestar"" or "" orkestar fejata sejdica"" for comparison (you will find them easier using these terms then translated ones).

""kolo"" means ""the wheel dance"", and there are loads of songs falling into that category. [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GUJSnq7CG0) is one of my favorites, it's ancient song.

as for brass bands check [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiTPAOghmrQ) video.

balkan includes few more countries which gave some great artists i could recommend (taraf du haidouks, fanfare ciocarlia, saban bajramovic, esma redzepova...).

[alexander nevsky 1938.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029850/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2) by eisenstein is incredibly well made movie, even by modern standards.

[chapayev 1934.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024966/) (more or less) realistic movie about red revolution.

[the white sun of the desert](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066565/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) cult movie in russia, and for a good reason IMO.

non-military peak into russian soul : [farewell 1983](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086149/) by elem klimov, one of my all time favorites.

i could also recommend [dersu uzala 1976.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071411/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) by akira kurosava, in russian. awesome movie based on true story of army cartographer mapping siberia.

while i'm not aware of detailed, valid study on the subject of ""impact of overheating by restriction foot ventilation"" right conditions would be too hot outside temperature during too long walk. it also depends on overall condition of the canine, type of surface, shade, dog's breed and many other factors - including dog colour."
srbistan,"any form of perspiration in mammals (no matter of it's other functions) also serves the purpose of heat dissipation. if you tuck your dog's feet into non breathable material you DO risk heat stroke - period. 

overheating needn't always be fatal, or even obvious, but it's there and will manifest itself given enough time and ""right"" conditions."

how many decent journalists ended up silenced one way or another (bought off, scared or had their character assassinated in front of wide audience)? check ""the dirty wars"" documentary, made by one of them. as for ""we don't kill journalists"" - remember that video manning got jailed in the first place? guy shot from the aircraft was AP cameraman - in effect a journalist.  
no mate, i don't think you (or me) have the major free press/media anymore. 

what you have (and russia too) is access to military communication system called Internet. one of it's current perks is an illusion of freedom of information. i say illusion as NSA made sure it's not exactly a freedom. once net neutrality is canceled by whatever legal or quasi legal act is in store these days that will go away too.  

one more thing you share with russia and that is - both countries are occupied by industrial military complex (as truman, if i recall correctly, wisely predicted). one in the US gives people illusion of choice and democracy, while russian gives the illusion of stability.

[great transport 1983.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086531/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) a movie spectacle for which no one really ever knew the exact budget.

[neretva 1969.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064091/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) - just check the cast (yeah it was made in communist country)

[sutjeska 1972.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070758/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) also an epic movie based on real life events.

srbistan,"IJW &amp; thank you very much, i never saw this one before, and i should have - great film."
srbistan,"IMO, there are movies about war, and there are war movies, where latter serve to lure schoolkids in boots (think ""green berets""). 

slightly off topic, hope OP won't mind... but, have you seen finnish [talvisota 1989.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098437/), while we're at raw movies?"

[human condition trilogy 1959.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053114/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

all of these are grim, black and white movies, void of spectacular SFX but present awesome stories, and are masterpieces of cinematography as an art form in every aspect. human condition is probably one of the best movies describing psychological change a man goes through (not a career soldier) in a war.

you could also check [hell in the pacific 1968.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063056/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) with toshiro mifune and lee marvin."

srbistan,"usually i read few books at the same time. at a moment i'm reading :

1. ""Shang Yang - the book of ruler of the Shan province"". it was written ~300 yr B.C. and is one of the foundation stones of chinese state. most things described are quite usable now days. think of it as machiaveli's ""prince"" in chinese, barren to the bone. extremely good, but darn hard reading (loaded with references to chinese philosophy and history i do not know enough).

2. ""all the shah's men"" by stephen kinzer, i just started it so i don't have an opinion yet, but it should be interesting, it's about iran in 20th century after CIA staged coup.

3. ""the good war - oral history of ww2""  by studs terkel, an amazing piece of history comprised of interviews and statements from participants in WW2 efforts (not only military personal). it shows the other side of what is generally considered ""a fair and good war"" - birth of military industrial complex in USA, depth of racial abuses and so on. max brooks ""copied"" style from this book in his WW Z. this book is so good it should be mandatory reading.

yesterday i finished  isak asimov's ""foundation"", an SF trilogy about predictability of human race, that really got me thinking. first two books are great, third one was a bit ... hollow, but all in all - worth reading.  i somehow missed goethe's faust, so this is the first next thing i'll read."

srbistan,"OP is just one of many people falling for good PR. while millions of people are dying of HIV/AIDS holy see still forbids them to use condoms, and what does the pope do - abolishes homosexuality!

catholic priests are sworn to celibacy, and that doesn't mean fucking only your own gender - it means sacrificing worldly pleasures for higher cause, and they know it. by abolishing homosexuality pope is merely pulling his own waning ranks closer together by being lenient on a minor ""sin"", while getting support from developed world for being ""modern"", ""open"", ""tolerant"" and so on.

that's just politics - vatican is loosing support around the world, surely you didn't expect them to sit idle for too long? i'll believe something changed once they start pursuing pedophiles within the church or putting wealth accumulated over last two thousand years to a good use (other then making bulletproof pope-mobiles)."

stalin lost his own son to nazis - refused to trade him, when he was captured by the germans. would you expect him to have pity for other people children? stalin was well aware (and rightfully so) what would happen to the russian people if nazis take over, and compared to that no sacrifice was too great. stalin was excellent war commander, and real blood on his hands is from before war, and in a short period after it."

srbistan,"[bed sitting room 1969.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064074/) by richard lester is weird post apocalyptic movie which i even wouldn't try to explain, but here is a good opportunity to suggest it.

[when the cat comes (az prijde kocour) 1963.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056844/) is czech movie, packed with symbolism on many levels. it is funny, beautiful to watch, and has a bit fantastic plot. atmosphere of the movie reminds me of brighter parts of bulgakov's ""master and margarita"" novel.

[hitokiri tenchu 1969.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200710/) is a movie about mythological (possibly historical) japanese samurai called Izo, and how he came to be. compared to the sequel this is pretty straightforward movie, but important if you don't know who Izo was. probably one of best shintaro katsu's (zatoichi; wolf and the cub...) roles .
follow up movie [Izo 2004.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377079/) starts literally at the last scene of the first movie, and is one of the most bizarre movies i've seen. not ashamed to say i saw it few times, and i'm still not sure if i understood it correctly. basically it's a struggle to avoid depths of hell and achieve eternal peace by any means necessary. directed by takeshi miike it's a feast for eyes.

be warned : these aren't your average hollywood movies! different style, different goals, unburdened by box office targets... good thing for artistic freedom, but if you're into hollywood cliches (clear division between good/bad and such simplifications) - skip them. also, they are not ""artsy-bullcrap"", that would better suit to r/wtf then r/movie.

srbistan,"thank you very much, it's kind of you to say so. as for australian cinema : i saw [mad dog morgan 1976.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074836/), story about australian natives - aborigines and convicts and was blown away. it's one of those movies that leaves you nailed to the chair few minutes after ending titles. not sure if this is exactly AU movie, but it's set there, and point of me mentioning it was -  i saw it only to learn of a similar movie called [the tracker 2002.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212132/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) by rolf de heer.
the tracker is about aborigines and white newcomers and their complicated relationship made very simple with a little help from large caliber rifle and gallows. gritty and dark, that movie left me humming ""every man"" tune for weeks after. 

one more comes to my mind, starring david gulpilil (guy from ""the tracker"", my what an actor!) - [walkabout 1971](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067959/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). this is better known movie, with plot easy to explain (kids stranded in desert survive thanks to the help of a young native), but point  obscured in layers of symbolism. 

as far as i'm concerned THE BEST movie coming from down under is [wake in fright 1971.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067541/) by ted kocheff - almost unknown (due to the fact it was considered missing until recently), gem starring donald pleasence and depicting life in australia's shitville and it's collision with logic and decency. 

i hope you'll enjoy some of these films :)

edit:messed up links"
srbistan,"australian cinematography in general is underrated IMO. they (aussie) may have not such big (in terms of volume) production as hollywood, but they beat the crap out of it in almost every god damn aspect of movie making. fair enough, this is a rather old and obscure movie, but many of the modern ones go down unnoticed as they haven't been hammered into audience's mind by ad/marketing cogs of the machinery.
i tend to avoid remakes, as i see no point in redoing something already made good, so ""day of the animals"" will have to wait for me to reincarnate, but ""castway on the moon"" sounds interesting, will check it out - thanks. in order to you return the favor, i'll bee free to recommend ""the naked prey 1966."", for that time ""indie"" movie. theme : man VS everything - nature, climate and other people as well (no it's not rambo 17. remake, nothing of the sort :) )."
srbistan,"[the long weekend 1978.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079482/)

srbistan,"someone told me this dialogue with a street urchin in india (not really a lie, but i think it qualifies) :

-all right then, do you need anything else?"
srbistan,"once while walking with my rottweiler (large, dominant male, hostile to other males and most of other animals) a stray kitten, few weeks old, just jumped in front of him out of the bush. before i could even open my mouth to say something Akish was already closing his jaws with kitten inside. (it was dark, night and grass was high, no way i could've seen that tiny cat)
i was petrified, i really like (all) animals and i thought that cat was surely gone for good. i came to my senses in a split second and shouted ""leave!"", upon which dog spits out the cat - a bit disoriented and all yucky and sticky of his saliva, but other than that unharmed and unscratched.  that's the kind of dogs rotties are...

truth to be said rottweiler can put an adult human in hospital or coffin quite easily (not many people realize HOW strong they are, not even the handlers/carers, as they usually don't show that strength while interacting with them). that is why this breed isn't for just anybody, one must know a lot about dogs to be able to enjoy rottie's company safely. more or less it's like having a gun or a car - unless you know what you are doing you are liable to hurt someone or yourself.

i had two rotties, both LOVED kids and were very stabile, but i never, ever left my dog with a child or a stranger unattended, it's just common sense for me. i also don't take my eyes off my unleashed dog while in walk. if dog gets a chance to hurt a human (kid in particular) - it's owners (and on occasion victim's) fault, dog does what he's been doing for thousands of years, nothing more, nothing less, humans are ones being constantly ""surprised"" with this! 

*victim's fault = illegal entry to premises, attack on the handler and generally - being stupid

btw- i avoid to use word ""owner"", all of my dogs were my friends, and one just doesn't own a friend."

croatia was nazi puppet state during the WW2, and they got their independence from yugoslavia, as a prize for that, so i don't count them as part of WW2 yugoslavia at all.

i fully agree that not all people of ex YU were against nazis - far from it, hell my country is full of neo-nazi scum even now, there must have been shit load of them during the nazi occupation, as collaboration was one way to survive.

srbistan,"you are right, they are energetic (certainly the most energetic in this small group), but can be trained/calmed easily, and are ""real"" dogs - which may be the underline of the ""not toy or too small dog"" sentence. "
srbistan,"i'm a former dog trainer/handler, and for some time i'm thinking about which dog should i take for my elderly (i'm dead if she reads this) mum, after our rottie passed away. so, here is my train of thought on the matter...
we're thinking smaller, not so strong dog, maybe even one whose size allows to defecate/urinate at home if need be (at place provided for that). also it should be one that can be taken over by yourself, or another handler/carer if 4 any reason your father can't look after it anymore (reads: breed not prone to biting ""new"" people). i would also recommend avoiding ""hunting"" and ""fetching""  breeds such as beagles, cocker spaniels etc. they tend to be more lively then other ""types"" of dogs due to their natural prey  drive (i do hope i got this clear enough in english... ). 

although breed is not a 100% guarantee of what you're going to get it does give you the basic idea what you can expect. [pug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug) might be the one you are looking for. they have awesome personalities - they do have character of their own (i do LOVE  dogs, but some are just plain morons, with IQ and capability to interact with humans comparable to the earthworm and yes it is closely related to the breed), but are calm and laid back, dogs. think of winston churchil in dogs body - that's the pug. 
pug is not a toy dog, it's just a dog small  in size and IMHO there is a big difference between these two. 

maybe even [hungarian puli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puli) or a [french bulldog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Bulldog), but latter can be too lively when young. [american basset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basset_Hound), is just marvelous dog (super smart, communicates well with humans, calm...), but they have enormous strength one would never expect from such a small animal.

all the best to your father (and the rest of your family, naturally), it makes me happy to see people thinking and researching before they commit themselves to such a huge responsibility such as having a dog around. &amp;yeah - don't forget to give us some pics once you get the dog."

srbistan,"never been to the USA, so i don't really know how the states are divided and borders marked, my Q was just a joke, but thanks 4 your answer :)"

srbistan,"[southern comfort 1981. ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083111/) movie by walter hill, about a squad of national guardsmen making their way across the luisiana swamps after pissing of some really dangerous cajuns who eliminate NGs one by one, while inducing horror on others.

although plot sounds like a cheap ass action movie it's nothing of the sort. "
srbistan,"yup... i've read it. does that change morbid comparison of war and a summer camp? maybe that was just a reference to south park which i didn't quite get...
"
srbistan,"realities?! ""Do you remember how when you came back from summer camp, coming back home seemed horrible? You had so much fun at summer camp..."" 
yeah, right recruitment officer, sir - summer camp! i'm trying real hard to stay polite here."
srbistan,"check out ""the plague dogs"", now that is messed up"

srbistan,"[how i won the war 1967.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061789/?ref_=sr_1)  - starring john lennon, surreal comedy about UK's africa warfare. 

i could also recommend ""adolf hitler, and my part in his downfall"", but i strongly suggest you skip the movie and read the book (there are several follow ups) written by spike milligan or - even better, get the audio book. it was read by milligan himself and is absolutely hilarious."

srbistan,"this movie is SO good... bye, bye scene (bravo, yankee, echo, dash bravo, yankee, echo) is one of my all time favorites - laughed my head off."
srbistan,"degrading rapidly, i don't even bother watching new hollywood movies unless i get recommendation from a VERY reliable source. IMO movies used to be a form of artistic expression, while now they are money machines for producers, and you can feel it."
srbistan,"would recommend [""the dead 2010.""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386925/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) not too stupid african Z movie, with some great atmosphere"
srbistan,"with that kind of budget it's hard not to make at least a half decent TV show, but that's all it is - half decent TV show i would find impossible to watch if i couldn't skip some parts.

things that pissed me off the most are that zombies are bleeding and none of the characters seem to have sense of smell (just imagine the stench of a horde of a rotting corpses)... even a freshly slain human stinks, let alone one left in a sun 4 too long."
srbistan,"whoever poured the most money in marketing. oscars are all about the popularity (save one for political correctness), nothing about the quality these days."
srbistan,"[vanishing point 1971.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067927/) is just a great movie, some think it's a ""car movie"", but i think it's much, much more.

[two lane blacktop](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067893/) is probably what you are after - two guys (no names - just driver and mechanic) going from town to town racing."
srbistan,"[captain john yossarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossarian) from ""the catch 22"". most conscripts will understand why.

srbistan,"[christiane F. 1981. ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082176/) was made by the book ""children of the ZOO train station"", which i read when i was a kid. book itself scared the fuck out of me, effectively keeping me away from heroin while (far too) many of my generation ""slipped"" on it.

story follows 14 YO girl experimenting with drugs ""as seen from a friend"" and slipping deeper into dirt of heroin addiction. compared to modern standards it's a mild movie (IMO very educational in it's sincerity), but thinking about the book still gives me chills."
srbistan,"it's the piece of bread for crying out loud, wtf is tagged as NSFW?! damn, politically over-correct people piss me off..."
srbistan,"the citation sums up the entire movie pretty well, and carries immortal truth about human society - there are people who NEED the war, however mind boggling that is for most people. if you think of it, these cannot be not only poor, starving ronins but also their mighty lords who would do more then kill themselves to start one, especially when they are safe and sound - away from battlefield. 

TL;DR : not only ""cannon fodder"" soldiers who earn their living killing fellow humans need war, but generals and politicians with enough power to start killing frenzy (war) on a grand scale too."
srbistan,"IMO this film (harakiri 1963.) basically deals with the absurdity and tragedy of individual in a samurai class. one movie, similar in theme, immediately comes to my mind - ""the fall of the ako castle 1978."", it's directed by kinji fukusaku (battle royale guy) which should be enough of recommendation.
i think it would be a good idea not to read about the movie prior to watching it."
srbistan,"never thought i would say this, but that is a beautiful kitchen appliance "
srbistan,"not exactly a nostalgia topic IMO, but hey... "
srbistan,"ok i'm officially confused, hats off 2 OP i almost forgot that feeling... "
srbistan,is there a link to this? i want to see for myself whether it is a fake or not...
srbistan,i thought these were called white trailer trash?
srbistan,"nor is NK... but the bottom line is ""International relations aren't fair."", that's what i'm talking about and something we can bouth agree with. :)"
srbistan,"israel is allowed to have a nuke and NK isn't, how come? which page in wikipedia covers that subject - please? oh, no need to answer, i got it - it's under ""double standards"" or ""hypocrisy""..."
srbistan,"IMO two worst screwed over people were Ascanio Sobrero and Hannibal. 

first one was the guy who invented nytro glycerine and passed his knowledge to alfred nobel, who took it (nytro glycerine) home and mixed it with some dirt he found in abundance where he lived (dirt turned out to be syllicate, just what was needed to stabilize the compound). now days almost no one even knows about Sobrero, while nobel is known worldwide and regarded as one of most important people in modern civilisation.

second would be unfortunate hanibal of carthage, who was sent ""for a walk"" from africa to rome with bunch of elephants, and when he finally got there (epic voyage comparable to frodo's in it's harshness) those who sent him refused to back him, which resulted in his demise, and eventual destruction of carthage itself in III punic war."
srbistan,"ok, fair enough - let's say i'm wrong and there was no nuclear explosion, which is quite possible, as i do know now what subcritical means (although in US military dictionary that probably means: ""we've managed to bypass material quantity restrictions imposed by proliferation treaty""). 

let me ask you about a purpose of this testing - was it humanitarian or military? that was my point, and i mentioned the pollux test only to illustrate that US is (very quietly) developing nuclear weapons while at the same time tries to prevent everybody else to do so, even though it is the only historically proven deterrent against US bullying.

now, that kind of attitude is fine in a strategy video game, but world doesn't quite work that way. not for a long period of time, at least."
srbistan,"proud of yourself for destroying an encyclopedia as a kid?!! arrogance is nothing but mature ignorance, indeed."
srbistan,"are you people for real ?! what would be the point of bomb that doesn't explode for fucks sake?!!

[THERE WAS EXPLOSION, but not nuclear chain reaction](http://www.globalresearch.ca/subcritical-underground-us-nuclear-bomb-explosion-test/5314635)"
srbistan,"which penninsula would they be conquering - please say it aloud and you might feel how silly it sounds to people out of US military propaganda reach. 

c'mon say it : ""koreans are invading KOREAN peninsula""! use your head, man... "
srbistan,"ok, let's say they make threats, but USA is making living hell for people worldwide - that's far beyond threat IMO and what about that?  what is more, did it ever occur to you that these threats serve the purpose of domestic propaganda? 
i'm not saying NK are angels, but there is only one way to keep USA away from your homeland, and that is having a nuke in a back pocket. now guess whose fault could that be? 
edit: typos"
srbistan,"just listen to yourself - one part of country ""invaded"" the other, and help (in form of liberators, not invaders) comes from few thousands miles away... check your dictionary for definition of ""invasion"", please."
srbistan,"oh no it doesn't - crater (cave in) can be seen from satellite, so there was a detonation."
srbistan,"how many of you people are aware that USA made (yet another) nuclear test in december last year? subcritical they called it... whatever the fuck that means it's still a nuke! what is more  i don't remember NK invaded any country, i don't remember them droping nuke on other nation - all i can remember is that only country ever to use nuclear weapon as such invaded Korea and started civil war that lasts until now.

you think NK nuke is the problem? think again..."
srbistan,looks like she broke/strained her wrist...
srbistan,"well, you people (canadians) are liked and respected around the world - why would you need a large army in the first place? on the other hand, your savage, filibustering neighbours do need all the army they can get."
srbistan,"DOT ass... two dots, to be more precise"
srbistan,"not sure what exactly do you mean by ""similar"", so i'll be at liberty to recommend the [Ensemble Renaissance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTFSBT97Ck) from serbia. they use reproductions of authentic medieval instruments in their music which contributes to ""rawness"" of their sound. they play all kinds of historical music, not only bysantinian/serbian.

[THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM4wH1q1jWw) is my personal favorite

edit : rough -&gt; raw"

srbistan,infrared or thermal? 
srbistan,"one would be surprised how effective these dummies are, even in the modern warfare... NATO made zounds of raids on dummies scattered around airfields in serbia in 1999. while the real planes were stashed away.
they also bombed the fuck out of refugee convoy (painted bright red), which tells me they can't really see all that well what is going on on the ground (or they just don't care to the point i find hard to believe)."
srbistan,"[une journee bien remplie 1973](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069443/) is basically movie about 12 assassinations committed by an elderly baker and his wife. each one is extremely well elaborated, theatrical and hilarious to watch.

as for the best movie killing, IMO that is probably ""wild bunch"" scene where an entire army is shooting one poor bugger for accidentally firing a gun (look on his face seconds before is priceless- guy should have gotten an oscar for it)..."
srbistan,poor soul should be fed only his previous handlers

srbistan,"it's a marching composition/song, like so many similar in history (turkish, radetzky or slavic march...) what is so fucking surprising with it being ""military""?!  as for ""the bosnian outcry"", it's nothing more than usual bosnian muslims propaganda tactic to slender anything serbian hoping to conceal the fact they are turning into sharia-law islamist shit hole in the middle of the europe...

if anybody cares : [march on drina is a beautiful piece of music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTNk8AOYtMY) with strong patriotic lyrics - it's about serbian struggle against austro-hungarians and ottomans in the first world war, when serbia lost ONE THIRD of it's male population. this particular march (march on drina) was composed some 100 years ago, when ""bosniaks"" did not exist as a nation but were simply called - muslims or locally known ""poturice""."

srbistan,ruffilosopher's stone?
srbistan,"i don't have to imagine doing that to my finger - i've tried it... not to the point of my finger coming off, naturally, but that would happen eventually. the general sensation is numbness, not the pain. also, i don't care about dogs showing emotions to humans, i never had problems with ""reading dogs"". whoever can't do that (and/or is unwilling to learn) shouldn't be around rottweilers in the first place. as for overall balance - rotties, as most molosses, are a bit clumsy by nature, due to their size. no tail in the world will change that, but if i ever train one as circus acrobat i'll keep in mind not to dock his tail.

i'm former army/security dog handler and trainer, and i relied upon, loved and respected all of my dogs, and would never, ever hurt any of these great animals for any reason other then their own benefit. IE: if i have to choose between risk of somebody injuring my dog's spine by breaking his tail and discomfort to the dog that lasts for a week or so - guess what i'll choose.

i fully appreciate your motives for this discussion, have no doubts about that, but there are reasons for tail docking as well as against. these are not so unconvincing if you think beyond exhibition ring, and people ""advocating"" it aren't sadistical loonies as one might conclude from your first post."
srbistan,"does not have to be painful if it's done with rubber rings while pups are very young (it just stops blood flow and tail falls off). you don't see the expression of pain on [these two animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_lambs_rubber_ring_tail_docking,_cropped.jpg), do you?

they (rottweilers) wouldn't have docked tails for ages if it wasn't more practical for working dogs with such a massive tail... tail is ""communication tool"" easily understandable for humans, dogs are quite capable of communicating without it, using complex body language and vocalization, therefore - it's important for humans, NOT dogs. 

now, there are a lots of doors in dogs life, lots of cretins who don't look where they will place their foot while walking... tail docking IS a good idea, when done right."
srbistan,have you tried verbal communication? from what i hear it's really convenient means of passing messages amongst humans...
srbistan,"my, my aren't we getting strong..."
srbistan,"fucking seagate! while back i bought two identical barracuda HDs with the idea of putting them in raid mirror. both of these died in less then 3 months time, due to a firmware error. one HD was on the ""black list"", other wasn't. needless to say i found out about black list's existance after HD was gone while trying to figure out what went wrong with almost new HD.
after LENGHTY correspondence with dozen of seagate staff company was ""eager"" to replace my (roughly 100e per piece) HD and restore my data for free... if i pay shipping costs to the courier company of their choosing which was roughly 200e per HD.

srbistan,"series ""yes minister"" and ""yes prime minister"" should be mandatory  in political schools, you can learn so much from them."
srbistan,"UR welcome, i'm glad you like the list, hopefully you'll enjoy some of these movies. again, few more not so well known, mostly older, mostly ""nuclear"" movies :

[five 1951](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043539/) is rather naive version of PA holocaust, but intelligent and has that ""emptiness"" charm.

[the earth dies screaming 1964] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058050/) isn't that bad

[the world, the flesh and the devil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053454/) is one of my favorites, starring harry belafonte.

[day the world ended 1955](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049128/) is surprisingly good movie in terms of acting, plot and the general feeling of it but be ready for silly 50'es rubber monsters.

[human highway 1982](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084099/) is totally weird movie, cross between surreal satire, PA, musical and comedy. surprisingly good cast.

[miracle mile 1988.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097889/) low budget, pretty simple and straightforward movie depicting few last hours of the civilization. it's very interesting to watch, but the ending kinda fucked it up.

[panic in year zero 1962](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056331/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) 60'ish like naive movie, obviously limited budget but ain't that bad at all.

[the day the earth caught fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054790/) exceptional british movie, well worth seeing, but expect no hollywood style suspense from it. about a journalist who accidentally breaks the news about earth going to hell.

[no blade of grass 1970.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066154/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) another great movie coming from the UK, about a family which tries to get to the safety in the wake of cataclysm and their interaction with increasingly violent and anarchistic fellow humans.

[autumn 2009](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1198333/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) i feel obliged to post something nice, but made this millennium... this should do the trick. best described as a zombie movie, but it's not that shallow as one might expect. has a decent story, characters are neatly drawn out and is very well acted.

[stakeland 2010](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1464580/) is the vampire movie made on small budget but it ""smells"" more of fallout than any other i've seen recently. has it own issues (ie. over bad ass characters) but interesting to watch.

[the bed sitting room 1969.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064074/?ref_=sr_1) this is completely crazy, surrealist british movie almost not possible to describe, but think of monty python's nuclear holocaust movie and you are close... it even has spike milligan (father of everything silly on TV) appearing in it.

you might also want to check out documentaries directed by [peter kuran](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0475571/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)

[radio bikini 1988.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893570/) is also a documentary, about nuclear testing conducted on bikini atol with some interesting footage and rarely heard voices of people who took part in those tests.

civilfence recommended some great movies - you definitely should check them out especially ""Z for zachariah"" and ""the war games"". hope you'll have a nice holiday :)"
srbistan,"i would substitute cricket ball with a hand granade, that should make it bit more interesting"
srbistan,"[naked prey 1966.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060736/)

[man friday 1975.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074849/)

[ten canoes 2006.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466399/) not really a survival movie, but about aborigin culture

[the bear](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095800/)"
srbistan,"first of all, you don't need to watch mad max 1 - you WANT to watch it. i'll add some more ""obscure"" PA movies i've seen, almost all of them post nuclear: 

[hell 2011](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643222/)

[ravagers 1979] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079777/)

[le dernier combat 1983](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085426/)

[things to come 1936](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028358/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)  now this is a rare gem, most likely the first PA movie ever made, before man discovered nuclear power, but still very watchable.

[Late August at the Hotel Ozone (1967)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061879/)

[malevil 1981.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082701/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

[defcon 4](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087130/) it's not the fourth sequel (have no fear) it's the full title of the movie 

[virus 1980](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080768/) by kinji fukasaku (battle royale director, an amazing character who grew up in A-bomb slum in hiroshima and has a thing or two to say about nukes and violence in general)

[when a wind blows 1986](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090315/) british animated movie is something really special, probably that's the way big boom would really look like for most of the human race.

[threads 1984](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090163/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) - i'm aware people have recommended this one before, but i want to make sure it catches your attention this really is a must see of the genre.

now if you find ""the road"" or ""book of eli"" to be fantastic, great and what not - chances are you won't like most of these i listed, but if you like PA themed movies you definitely should check them out... fair warning, though i hope you'll enjoy :) "
srbistan,"i always disliked collectors crap, but this is awesome, mr house would like one too... "
srbistan,"if you liked ciudad de deus chances are you'll like this one : [Pixote 1981.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082912/) 

movie about homeless kids trying to survive in sao paolo. there were no professional actors in the movie, all kids were recruited from the streets. one of my all time favorites, reminds me a lot of bunuel's ""los olividados"", but FAR more realistic and brutal. "
srbistan,"love the ""was"" part... "
srbistan,how about stretching legs feeding a homeless person or somebody who really needs it instead of fat fucks too lazy even to go in a proper restaurant - on foot? fuck i hate the christmas hysteria and hypocrisy.
srbistan,[ofelas AKA the pathfinder 1987](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093668/)
srbistan,"paris (france)! now that was hilarious, i thought it was the one in texas.."
srbistan,i'll tag along with one more corbucci's great western  - [companeros (1970.)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066612/)
srbistan,"great suggestion, but comparing it to forest gump is a blasphemy, maybe that's why... i see the resemblance, but these two are really incomparable IMO.  got my vote though, i'm too big fan of peter sellers to be bothered with details :)"
srbistan,"this is rather obvious, but just in bieber : [the fall of saigon 1995](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217473/)"
srbistan,"[La cité des enfants perdus 1995. (city of lost children) ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112682/) too surreal even to start explaining it, but actually has a plot and a very interesting one.

first five movies by [jean jaques annaud](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000269/)

[Au Hasard Balthazar (1966)] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060138/) B/W drama, unsettling and hard to watch, but captivating.

i've recently seen this post apocalyptic gem - [malevil 1980](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082701/)

and of course (this will probably be the 100th time i'm recommending this one) [Une journée bien remplie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069443/) darkly humorous comedy with almost no dialogues."
srbistan,"thanks for the suggestion OP, definitely one of the best movies of the genre."
srbistan,"[anderson tapes 1971. ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066767/) movie starring young sean connery and christopher walken (as a kid) that deals with high tech espionage of individuals. apart from being great movie in a sense of acting, plot, twists and surprising ending (i'm REALLY hard to surprise) - that ""high tech"" part is very interesting to see as it was made 40 yrs ago, so usage of spying technology (all analogue and mechanical) goes hand in hand with clever ways of using it.

[Z (1969) ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065234/?ref_=fn_al_tt_9)  film made by kosta gavras, basically teaches everything you need to know about right wing groups of ""spontaneously organized"" citizens, which from no modern society is free. based on a true story, this movie is made by friends of famous greek politician (gregoris lambrakis) depicted in a movie. very emotional, great film music, superb acting.

edit: anybody mentioned the old  version of ""manchurian candidate"", with sinatra?"
srbistan,"first time i heard of this movie was in news article titled something like ""loads of parents sue TV network over their children nervous breakdowns""... needles to say i was intrigued and had to know what the fuck happened, and story was - they aired this movie in an early time slot, tagged it as a children movie and folks left their kids (some of which very young) to watch this great animated crime mystery with all it's gory details. 

easily one of the top three or four animated movies i've ever seen, so sorry i can only upvote this suggestion once."
srbistan,"in slavic languages ""ovcharka"" means shepherd (dog), while ""ovarka"" can be roughly translated as ""something cooked"" :)

srbistan,"ravenous 1999. - pay no attention to horror genre tag on it, it must've been tagged that way by someone who had humour glands surgically removed. 

man bites dog 1992 - dark and violent comedy, but truly funny and surprising.

tucker and dave VS evil 2010. - darkly humorous movie. this one is lightweight teen movie, compared to previous two.

Une journée bien remplie 1973. - old school dark humour, an obscure masterpiece. don't be too bothered if you can't find subtitle for it, as there are 2-3 sentences exchanged through entire movie (if you are having trouble finding it PM me)

Signore e signori, buonanotte 1976. - trippy italian skit movie (with a political agenda), closest italians ever came to monty python. 

Brutti, sporchi e cattivi (ugly, dirty and bad) 1976. - comedy about dysfunctional, poor italian family. too weird to describe, hilariously funny to watch.

maybe the first two aren't exactly ""lunch time movies"", but all listed are well worth seeing and made me laugh (NOT an easy task)."
srbistan,"""84 charlie mopic"" - war movie, but a good one - not an army propaganda flick. 

Trollhunter isn't that bad actually... and it ain't a horror. 

Ever Since the World Ended (2001) is quite good. two guys are making documentary about post apocalypse LA which is now inhabited by ~200 people now.


""punishment park"" sounds promising, thanks samizdada!"
srbistan,"the reason for it is that some churches (ie. christian orthodox) still use [Julian calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar).  easter and other holidays shared with other christian churches are also time shifted accordingly (roughly two weeks later).

besides regular (gregorian) new year, most people in serbia also celebrate the so called ""serbian"" new year which falls on 13th of january and is nothing more than Julian new year, but is a good excuse to party more."
srbistan,"what you probably read about - i lived through and remember seeing those people in real time. from good old point of view  of good VS evil, releasing of those two men today was bad thing to do. 
as for 400 yrs serbian of aggression i suggest you do some basic balkans history research and you'll find out amazing stuff to deny that. 

ftr my point : all war criminals need to be prosecuted and punished according to what they have done, regardless of their nation. no exceptions, no excuses. that is the only way of reconciliation i still hope is possible. "
srbistan,"regardless of nationality one must feel disgust at hague tribunal for acquitting those bloodstained murderers and for perversion of justice they exercised today. those two monsters disguised as human beings orchestrated an  exodus of civilians from croatia which resulted in hundreds of thousands people left homeless, thousands killed, tortured. no one ever answered for it, be it higher ranking brass or an actual culprit. 

stench of moral decay... nothing like it in the morning!"
srbistan,"holy smokes, that's my favorite coffee shop right on the corner! maybe we can get together?"
srbistan,"dear idle eric,

i recently ""discovered"" spike milligan's work, namely - Q series, and ever since i can't shake off the feeling pythons have borrowed far more from him then they care to admit. honestly - am i wrong here?

btw - pythons forever! i really love your past work (aka - not a python hater, far, far, far from it)! also, i wish you success with your latest project, seems promising - can't wait."
srbistan,JUST to eat?! do you even hear yourself?
srbistan,fuck those bitches!! man i wish i could hunt for hunters... now that would be a sport for me.
srbistan,i once read about a priest in the UK who had a potato surgically removed from his anus. when asked how it got there he replied it was due to an accident - he claimed to have fell on it.
srbistan,"What amazed me in particular about this news is the fact that USA asked Google ~ 8000 times for user data, while Russia did the same 58 times in the six months period.

srbistan,"my apologies, somebody else did - thought it was you... your reply was surprisingly polite and to the point indeed. cheers"
srbistan,"so i'm a prick for not believing something that we agree wasn't proven? as i said - fair enough... 
while i don't contest your right to believe, nor do i mock you for believing it (if any of those are what bothers you), knowing i MAY be wrong - i still do not believe for reasons i already explained."
srbistan,"what exactly convinced you there really is (presumably) a nice old lady answering your questions? no need to answer this, really, as i see no point in going on with this conversation - just think about it."
srbistan,"cetnik?! you are just another stupid racist, not worth the air you are breathing. have fun :)"
srbistan,"why is that, for having my own opinion and habit of questioning things instead of blindly believing what other people say?! ok - i'm a dick..."
srbistan,would you mind translating that for those nice people in the audience? i'm sure they would be impressed with your fabulous arguments as much as i was ... 
srbistan,"damn sharp eye you have, bravo!"
srbistan,"i know exactly what pita is, no need for translation, and tried to explain what else throws me off (to the best of my abilities, given i don't speak english very well). 
as for pita - my family also endured period of famine, and i know for sure pita is very consuming dish to prepare, not the stuff you make in desperate situations with minimal resources.

i also gave an idea on how to prove authenticity... just saying."
srbistan,"not buying any of this... average/amateur historian with interest in this particular era could easily answer these questions, and anyone could get an elderly person to hold a piece of paper with today's date scribbled on it.. also, most answers are too politically correct and forgiving to come from 90 year old person who lived through hell.
i'm of slavic origin, and most of this sounds really hollow and unconvincing knowing the mentality of the people (and yes i was aware of great famine prior to this AMA, and no i'm not denying it nor trying to diminish suffering of the ukrainian people). 

an official document with name, issued by USSSR authorities at the time and newly issued one where same name could be seen WOULD be a proof. (simply edit out name or surname using image editing software if concerned about privacy)

ps.

""pita"" is pastry made out of flour, cooking oil (or lard) and stuffing. it takes time to bake, as well as place and fuel to do so. if you have only flour - you don't make pita, you would make something else... ;)"
srbistan,they haven't seized a hospital - but an oil field... well ain't that a surprise!
srbistan,"what they will do : crumble into smaller, easier to eradicate/assimilate groups

killing off competition : they could also grow tobacco, killing off any BAT salesman, still - they ain't doing it, they buy smokes at a tobacconist - right? (there is BIG money in tobacco, also). same is with drugs, only popular perception is different.

what makes you think it's stupid idea? only place where it was tried was portugal, and again - read cato's report for obvious results. people are aggressive protecting their livelihood no matter if it's farming or drug dealing - it's not ""violent population of brasil "".

given the choice of ""embracing healthy capitalism"", as you put it (i for one don't think capitalism is healthy at all) - effectively not messing with the armed MPs and living everyday in fear of loosing your head - what would you choose? most drug lord's ""troops"" aren't first world YOLOs, but young people doing what they can to survive."
srbistan,"people don't support drug lords out of loyalty. it's about survival, both economical and physical - they give ""bread"" and safety. take it away - and you'll see drug organizations crumble into dust and disappear, much faster then you could imagine (saw 4 myself what happened with several crime groups once they run out of cash..).

IMO - solution can't be simpler, the only question is - how come a dumb ass such as myself can think of it, and governments around the world ""can't"". meaning - brazil (like most countries) is not solving the cause, but fixing the consequence."
srbistan,"either kurds are not human beings worthy of compassion, or turkey is member of NATO and therefore excused for all evil imposed on minorities and neighbors. now what could it be?"
srbistan,"how about really solving the problem - legalizing all drugs? decriminalizing them would do the trick as well. judging by rising numbers of addicts - current laws on drugs worldwide are failing. it's like water - you can't stop it, you can only divert it. 

as long as there is business with high profits involved, which takes no schooling and not much investment there will be people dealing in illegal substances (be it alcohol or cocaine), and violence will follow. take profits away and you took the main motive to deal drugs and need for violence to protect your ""business"". most criminal organizations around the world rose to power on money made from smuggling business, it takes no eliot ness to figure that out.

please read the Cato institute report on drugs decriminalization in portugal before arguing further."

srbistan,"OK, point taken and i agree with what you are saying, but different parts of the wall were built using different techniques. one in particular used highly compressed dirt between supporting (outer) walls. dirt was compressed by large mallets pounding it from the top. 
if you were to put human body under shallow layer of earth (and pound it mercilessly for a long time) it would be literally beaten into a pulp, which would mix with surrounding material rather than being foreign object within it.
also, this is a bit gross, most of labourers were skinny slaves which means there isn't much to rot and produce gases that would weaken the structure. also, we are talking about HUGE structure, where one skinny body here and there might not make difference.
as i said - your theory makes a lot of sense, and surely they didn't make it (the wall) out of dead chinese people, but i wouldn't discard reports that there are bodies built in the wall. "
srbistan,"not to mention kitty-burgers and hot-kitten, famous national dishes sold in the mc donalds which is situated in a part of mentioned monastery. part of which was adopted specially to host it, thus making it the oldest mc donalds building in the world... 

ох итћс њу агаин!"
srbistan,"once the wall was built - there were little chance of being ""buried within the wall"", as repairs were not on such a massive scale, so guards aren't likely to be buried in it.

however, when the wall was being built dead workers were often buried in it, as it was more efficient and potentially less dangerous (diseases concern) then shallow graves around labourers settlements."

srbistan,"it doesn't ""rate"" because USA weapons industry is the main supplier of guns to mexican gangs, and USA are the main importer of drugs pushed by mexico gangs. saying that publicly would attract attention on failed gun trade control, immigration policy, drug laws enforcement policy, leaky over-fucking-expansive borderline (or HUGE corruption case)... 
you name it - they have failed it, so it's kinda obvious why obama didn't raise the question.

as for romney... well, have you ever heard of poor guns maker? neither have i... romney relies heavily on that kind of people and wouldn't do anything to upset their operations, and donations. "

srbistan,"separation anxiety (in vast majority of cases) stems from the fact that dog thinks she is the one that should decide how long the play or interaction should last. if it's too short - she shows her disapproval quite clear. gipsy is 3yo - and she will not ""grow over it"", if she hasn't until now.

i realize enforcing strict pack hierarchy isn't really popular on this subredit, but you are the one that should command QUIET (whatever the actual command might be), and dog must obey or be trained to do so. if you think it's cruel - think of possible consequences and compare.

best thing you could do is to break the circle. when gipsy goes ballistic refocus her attention on something else (command sit, down, show her her favorite ball she would get once she calms..), but DO NOT pet your dog  (in attempt to calm her) while in over-anxiety phase as it will reinforce her belief she is doing it right."
srbistan,"ok, but don't you think media coverage of 14yo made her popular enough to make her a target? there are adults advocating the same cause, why then pick a child for your poster anti-islamist, when there are more persuasive and eloquent people to do so?

advocating the right to education clearly IS a political issue in afghanistan (however strange it may seem to us) - some people there obviously take that as serious as you would take call for jihad coming from a 8yo, and are willing to go into extreme over it. whoever broke the ""malala story"" must have been thinking the same way you did, and not taking in account possible consequences to the child. 

again, try not to judge what any of those kids are saying from your own perspective. focus on the facts - kid is making political statement, kid is giving a political speech, kid is getting assassinated... no kids in politics - none of that would have happened."
srbistan,"how different is 14 yr old anti-islamic political activist in afghanistan from her 9 yr old pro-islamic counterpart in australia ([this one](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/girl-8-calls-on-islamic-youth-to-back-jihad/story-e6frg6nf-1226475239074))? try not to think about what is ""just cause"", as in that age sense of justice is planted by surrounding (family, school, available media etc.).
IMO both are school examples of children being used for political causes, which is banned by the declaration of children rights, if i'm not mistaken. both are too young to have their own opinion based on experience and facts, and both are plunged into very dangerous game by the adults... 

just wondering what does reddit think about it from this perspective - are we turning blind eye on breaking of one of basic ""western"" civilization principles which is ""leave the kids alone""?"

srbistan,"does the nuclear disaster counts? if so - ""the road"" just hurts the brain how stupid it is, and this comes from an post apocalyptic movie lover. it saddens me to see people claiming it to be ""their favorite post-apocalyptic"", not knowing how hollow this movie is compared to a few older ones that definitely would not go on sale in walmart. here's a short list of things that could easily make this movie far better IMO:

1. there is only one black guy in the movie (maybe two, not sure if it's the same person). i'm not being politically correct here, but there must be at least 1/3 of non white people in the USA, so where to fuck did they all disappear - latinos, asians, black people?!

2. what happened to all the bicycles in the USA? come on, pushing 3inch wheeled trolley across the half of the damn continent... surely ""the great survivor"" would come up with something better

3. people are on the brink of starvation, yet the happy (white, all blue eyed aryan - of course) family roams around with a healthy (reads: tasty) looking dog amongst cannibal infested country.

4. people with severed limbs surviving their wounds without any medical treatment.

5. not being able to find more than TWO .38 caliber bullets in the USA, place where 80/100 people own handgun?!! who buys a gun with two bullets in the first place? you get a box or two, right?

6. people would start falling apart from scurvy after some 3-4 months without vitamin C

7. try not washing hair for 2 weeks or face for a week and see what happens. after a few months of poor/no hygiene people turn into messy lice infested scare crows, they do not look ""though"" and a bit rugged.

this film really pissed me off. one can clearly see it had a big budget, solid casting and potential to be good movie. instead we got pathetic story, naive propagation of family values, adverts for coca-cola and del monte (that was miserable) and WTF feeling after watching it. IJW defcon 4, which was probably made on 100X less budget, some 30 years earlier and it's still 100X better."

srbistan,"peace in europe?! if what you meant to say was ""lack of armed conflicts within the EU"" - fair enough, but wars are now fought economically, so peace is very arguable term.
as for europe as a whole, statement ""67 yrs of peace"" - is utterly untrue. let me remind you of nineties in balkans, for starters. war that could have easily been avoided if western europe wasn't so high on their own vision of rectitude, free markets and socialism bashing.
then NATO war against former yugoslavia not approved by the UN, with its unilateral ""solution"" - giveaway of one sovereign nation's province to aggressive minority... vicious violence towards minorities on kosovo (now minorities, after decade of EULEX earning peace prize for EU i guess) never stopped - it was just pushed under the rug.
macedonia in the beginning of 2000's...

IMO, organization which supports proxy wars, topples foreign governments, trades in weapons, whose member states still have dominions worldwide and threaten less developed nations with nuclear weapons and god knows what else - should not be even considered for peace prize. after ahtisari and obama got their blood stained medals, peace prize to the EU comes not so much as a surprise.

as for prussia and british empire, someone mentioned - they are live and kicking. they can change colors and names all they like, but the fact that 4th reich is rising, and brits still have colonies worldwide can't be denied."
srbistan,"prussians did, and ottomans waited patiently to see who will be the winner, no?"
srbistan,"if you don't see anything in common with the situation before first or second world war - you ought to change your glasses, and my wording is not coincidence, nor lack of knowledge of history."
srbistan,"this is not retaliation, it's an attack on a sovereign country, an act of war. syria had every right to attack terrorist camps in turkey (as turks routinely attack targets in iraq, or USA in pakistan - for example). 

point is that ottomans are raising their ugly aggressive head again! first they provide arms, logistics and shelter to islamist terrorists worldwide who wage war against sovereign nations, and now they don't hesitate to attack syria when they try to defend themselves from attacks originating from turkey. 

IMO ottomans are either trying to provoke a response that would justify NATO assault on syria, or are expanding their reach as local power. they need to be stopped before it's too late! "

srbistan,"so truth... i try very hard not to hate myself for quitting job and going to a college, doing my f*cking masters, learning three languages - and now i can't even get my old job back. damn i feel so stupid sometimes!"
srbistan,why does any sane answer here gets downvoted?! hive mind at it's worst...
srbistan,"people - get real, either this dog is going to stop biting people or he goes back to the breeder (which is not very likely considering his history and the fact he's been neutered), or to the shelter where from (again, with his history) is not likely to get rescued.

alternative to ""not being rescued"" is quite clear, and ""forcing a dog"" is far less troublesome IMO... as i said, this is no ""no nonsense"" approach, based on years of dog (and dog packs behavior) watching, and it tries to emulate process of passing knowledge in the pack of canines. ""forcing"" is the term used in lack of a better one.

also, i've seen too many ""modern"" and ""progressive"" wannabe trainers wasting precious time and misleading dog owners with ""tender magic wand"" solutions to be bothered with them anymore. i'm quite aware ""no nonsense"" approach sounds harsh, but it is effective and reliable on this evolution stage of canine species (implying - dogs haven't changed much in last few thousands of years, only human perception did).

confusion in dogs mind, that derives from messed up pack hierarchy, can be far more stressful then basic obedience course. often it ends with dog being put down, and avoiding that is the goal."
srbistan,"dominant yes - fearful not. it's not pissing it off, but enforcing natural (natural for dogs) pack order where it has been disrupted."
srbistan,she is beautiful that's what she is! :)
srbistan,"first of all your dog was just a big pup before he reached 1.5 yrs. as soon dog reaches sexual maturity, hormones kick in (bio-clock, not related with him being neutered), and his behavior changes rapidly. this can be fixed, but it takes time, work and in most cases i've seen - the change of owners habits and behavior as well.
some Q's for you:
-did the dog have any training, does he knows basic commands (down, sit, stay, heel)? 
-did any of the bitten people approached him from behind or while he was feeding, playing or having his toys nearby? 
-is the dog allowed in your bed, bedroom or on sofa? (absolutely shouldn't be, this is of ultimate importance)
-does he have toys or anything that ""belongs to him"" (take them away now, give them back only for a short period of time, only as a reward for exercise well done at this point)

1. test his hearing and eye sight, they might be poor and that could be the reason (dog surprised by sudden appearance of hand near his head).

2 try muzzling him, then repeating the scenario which triggered the bite - see what happens.  

there are number of reasons why dog would bite, but fear biting (not likely with a dog you described - friendly akita) and dominance/ hierarchy issue are the most common. my guess is the latter. 
few things you could do with a dominant dog in order to get him into permanent submission : try reinforcing your dominance over the dog. FIRST muzzle the dog, then make it lay down and wait  (on command). this may require some force to be applied on the animal, and this is normal in dog packs. NEVER strike (hit) your dog, but do not hesitate to force him into submission using check-chain collar and leash!

when you get the dog to lay down before you - you get him into a submissive state, the idea is to prolong it and let him know THAT is the natural pack order (you order, he obeys or suffers consequences - namely has to stay down or be dragged and held down).  look closely how he reacts to this command - is he scared, agitated, excited... he should be calm, and patiently wait for your permission to get up. 
as soon as he is down and does not try to get up by himself - praise him, but not too enthusiastically. 

repeat this exercise very often, but try not to make pattern out of it - try different situations, locations, level of distraction (this at later stages) and so on... (all of this presuming dog knows the command and listens to you, but if you are unsure MUZZLE HIM - do not take chance in the beginning). combine this with other basic obedience exercises, but ""down "" is the most influential.

once you (the pack leader) reinforced your pack status, than your wife should repeat the same process. firm and steady, if she is angry with the dog - it shows and will hardly have an effect. if the anger is present all the time, better give the dog back - better for all. 

if you decide to ask professional trainer for help - always be around, do not take your dog to a training school and leave it there! also, some of the things i wrote may sound rough, even abusive, but are not - it's so called ""no nonsense approach"" to dog training. hope this will help, good luck and ask if  you need further info we/i can provide."
srbistan,"national pig association... bit confusing name, or is it just my monty-pythonized brain?"
srbistan,"yes, that is the correct expression! thank you very much for your help.

edit: i really do hope i didn't confuse anybody, it's a big difference between these two... i'll have to be far more careful what i write."
srbistan,"i hate being pathetic, but the levee broke yesterday... thank you for the kind words."
srbistan,"reinforcing REACTION, that has root in fear... sorry if i was unclear on that. as for hand feeding, i strongly believe one should try everything else before trying to bribe a dog, and treats are just that.
as i said, there is no universal solution, only the one that works (and puts least stress on the animal) - one i recommended worked for me on couple of occasions."
srbistan,and i think to myself - what a wonderful world...
srbistan,"sorry, but i can't agree to feeding treats (at this stage) to a dog in over-anxiety state. it can reinforce it's current reaction, which is undesired. basically you would be rewarding her for fearing you. also, hand feeding dogs is not recommended for unstable dogs, as food giveaway is a sign of submission in dog packs, and you are not quite sure what causes the reaction - it might be hierarchy confusion.

instead try playing with your dog near the house with her favorite toys (say - fetching ball) and gradually try to get closer and closer to the house, with the goal of taking the ""play"" inside. point is to to keep her occupied with pleasant activities and not giving her time nor chance to feel fear.

even better (may not work at first, depending on how scared she is) if dog does not have this kind of reaction to other household members let them start the play inside, then you join - praising it her all the time, till it relaxes. passing a ball between you and kids, or something like that.

you might also teach her and practice few basic commands outdoors, and then repeat it inside, praising her lavishly - to make her understand she did something right (treats are OK for this).

note1 : stroking a dog on her belly has comforting effect on dogs (when dogs are doing that to each other they are saying ""it's ok - relax"").

note2: try changing your visual appearance (if you wear slippers, house robe, or track suit - try changing it. something like that (you don't wear on, while outside) might be a trigger).

note 3: get as low as possible, maybe even lying down on a floor while playing 

note 4 : absolutely no (human2human) arguments or yelling in front of her

had a dog with a problem like yours recently and fixing it (the problem) might take a while so be patient. really nice to know you are trying, keep up the good work, surely it will ""pay"" off. btw,  there is no ultimate, right way of dealing with issues like this as dogs are individuals, so Otto might be right, and i could be wrong. what i wrote is from personal experience, and in best faith possible."
srbistan,"thank you, will keep that in mind."
srbistan,"point is not to stare straight it in the eyes, as they can see that as a challenge, not to avert your eyes totally. it would be foolish not to look at a dog barking at you (look in it's feet) as it might attack and catch you unprepared. 
if it scared you - take a few moments to get your breathing in normal, compose yourself, then walk slowly (don't run) past it. if you feel endangered in future (careless owner, chance of really being attacked) - get a pepper spray. 
one more thing, dogs can sometime freak out on women having their period, for number of reasons (no way of knowing OP's gender, no insult meant...).
also, dogs change habits - where one dog ignored you one week it might go berserk the following, no guarantees if it's not your dog.

best thing to fend off dog going for you (it happens often if you're a jogger: sweating intruder running away - in their eyes) is patent umbrella opened in it's face (99% of untrained dogs would back off or run away)."
srbistan,"change the food, and do not feed him anything else but that one brand of food (no dog treats, no food leftovers - nothing) . see what happens. if it doesn't help - try another brand, till you find one that doesn't give it so much gases (dog will always fart to some extent)

avoid chicken based food, as it smells worse than beef based food when it oxydates (think it's due to sulphure content in chicken). feed it only dried granulated food (avoid canned food ).
also, shorter expiry date on food means - less preservants in it, equals - less farts.

if dog needs to loose weight feed it less, and exercise more with it (do not overdo it - dogs have rather weak heart). do not feed the dog food with less than 20% of proteins. there is nothing wrong with dog being hungry all the time (i know it may sound cruel, but it ain't if you know you'll be prolonging his life this way).
of course - do not starve the dog, and if you decide on reducing food input - do it gradually!
also, you can skip feeding it one day a week or once a month. it's good to clear dog's digestive tract. 

good thing to clean your dog's intestines is to mix wood chippings with it's food once a week (small ratio : ~5% no more than that). it's also good for cleaning of the anal gland (it hardens it's feces). 
VERY, VERY FINE wood chippings - no sharp pointed shards!!! for example those you would get when you apply fine file on a wooden plank  (chippings might not be the correct word, but as non native english speaker i'm not aware of a better term).

as the dog gets older it's gases start to smell worse, get used to it to some degree."
srbistan,"generally i tend to avoid western/cowboy movies, but i read about a sergio corbucci's film with j.l trintignant and decided to have a look, surprised to know there is a western with a frenchman (not speaking a word of english) in it. it was ""il grande silencio"" aka ""great silence"", which turned out to be great movie in most aspects one can judges movies.
then i saw ""the companeros"" by the same director, and - it also blew my mind. in particular, the ending of both movies is hard to predict, which is next to impossible for westerns. i have that problem with hollywood movies - after 20 mins (as soon as all characters rolll out) i know what is going to happen at the end."

srbistan,"i'm disputing reuters report on comparison between pre pahlavi, and post pahlavi era by stating that effects of UN sanctions are the main reasons for people are living worse now, not the iranian revolution.
as you quoted wikipedia to support your statement, i just wanted to point out the fact that some of it's parts are written by spinners from various parties involved, so it's not really trustworthy (surely iranians do the same on arab wiki). wasn't my intention to drift away or water down the story... chill :)

as a person who lived through years of UN sanctions in my country i can tell you for sure they are not harming regime in any way, whatsoever, but are hurting the ""small people"" and pushing them even further against ""the evil west"" which keeps them hungry. extremists flourish in misery, and probably the best example for that was hitlers rise to power by stabilizing german economy.

total sanctions are counterproductive, especially if you have in mind that western banks did not have issue with laundering iranian money, or pushing it here and there. plenty of indie-arms dealers, or plutionium bars, no worries.

you say iran is not innocent. ok, what is their sin? so far : threats against israel and attempts to build nuclear power plant. how come france or germany can have nuclear power plant, and iranians can't?  IMO it is far better to know what is going on, even assist them all the way building those plants, supply every gram of material they need - because that way you can know if ""few kilos"" are misplaced and take appropriate actions. 

100% right about the need and advantages of secular government, now and always. religious gov't is the problem, but it's their problem and i can only pity them for it. i don't think crusade would sort anything, though, and by threatening them with crusades - one only strengthens position of extremists who can than say ""we told you they are about to attack as""."
srbistan,"you are taking the liberty of commenting things you don't have a clue about in the first place, and now you even won't admint wrong, let alone not repeat it. your statements are based on your feelings, not on facts, and i'm pointing that out, as this is your predominant attitude in this discussion.

i do not quite understand what you are saying, but to make this clear - i'm talking about taxes which were used to develop SFRY as a country. SFRY was a federation, and all the republics payed taxes in proportion to their GDP, which were going to the central bank and then distributed as needed. exception to that was ""kosovan tax"", which existed only in serbia.
further more most of the country (SFRY) was rebuilt by its people through ""working actions"", which were mass building projects mostly done by youth. foreign aid for SFRY was not significan part, as the country took CREDITS (funds were seldom given to it), which are still being payed off by former republic, now states.
serbia did rebuild kosovo, as it was part of it's territory and by far most underdeveloped as it was the longest under the turkish occupation.

my mentioning of GENOCIDE (not massacre - that was a genocide, you would still end up in french jail, you know..) and your attitude towards it (again - not just a massacre) clearly shows how biased and distorted your judgement is. 
and - no, serbia did not the same. as i wrote earlier, after UN exhumations in Rachak village (which was the excuse for nato air attacks that drove serbs out of kosovo) NOTHING was found. there were war crimes, as it was dirty, nasty civil war but all accused serbs were tried and are now rotting in prision, as they should. there are still thousands of missing serbian civilians - no high ranking albanian was ever convicted, but there are witnesses coming out of hiding lately, so we shall see.

one more difference between kurds and albanians is that albanians did not have reason to rebel, as kurds do. they (albanians) could live in serbia as all the other minorities (1.3 million minority citizens in serbia now), but instead they used terrorism tactics against all serbian citizens (not only serbs).  their goal was not better life, freedom (as they already had those, as explained in previous posts) but independence from serbia which will never happen. fair enough, someone very strong snatched it away, as turkey once did, but as soon as the ""gorilla"" currently hoovering over so called kosovo goes away, guess what - there will be another war. by supporting this land grab you are indirectly supporting war and further suffering of both albanians and serbs. think about it, out of all people in the world you turks should know the best - we ain't giving up, not even after 4 centuries of david VS golitath kind of struggle.

you may like albanians, that is your prerogative, but truth about kosovo and metochia is very far away from what you are saying. the fact we are talking about ALBANIANS seeking for independence for KOSOVO says enough for itself. what you are saying is that southern part of USA should seek independence or join mexico, because there are lots of mexicans there. that is simply not the truth, it is not according to international laws, nor tradition.

i did answer your question, but i don't mind repeating : kosovo was being developed ever since WW2.  now it's plunged back into medieval, and became main european drugs, slave, and illegal organs smuggling route. good work!"
srbistan,"must say i'm glad this little chat of ours is starting too look like a proper discussion, no insults and so on... too tired now, gotta crash, but before i do here's a bedtime story regarding that wiki link :

srbistan,"reuters is clearly aligned source, good only as a news lead. IMO they exceeded good old CNN lately as nato propaganda bullhorn. if you rely on their editorials i must admit i overestimated you (not to be taken as an insult, refering to how well informed you are). anyhow - i was talking about vast majority of the population who in monarchy didn't have even basics, country which was non industrialized exporter of cheap oil only. for that kind of country construction of nuclear powered reactor in 30+ years is big success, that fuels national pride etc.

iran is under heavy sanctions for some time now, and that reflects on average people income and quality of life.
not sure about vitriol, i quoted you : ""In fact, as a nation and politically, we collectively despise Iran on many levels. ""
i may have misunderstood (though i fail to see how), but i wasn't trying to put words in you mouth."
srbistan,"so you will ignore first part, keep quiet about the last and not answer the middle one - is that it? i won't argue that, you've proven my point.

btw
for denying the genocide of armenian people you would end up in jail in france, and rightfully so!"
srbistan,"you can fool some people sometimes, but you can't fool all the people all the time"
srbistan,"remember how current iranian regime got to power, islamic revolution? ever since they see progress in their country (which was ruled by western lap-dog monarch), and they seem quite happy with it. have no illusion they are being forced into living in sharia - it just works for them. therefore anyone who tries to ""liberate"" them from themselves shall be seen as enemy, which is only natural. what's more ""liberators"" will have to come up with something close to the ""final solution"", as they will be going against coherent nation of some 80 million people. that's a lot of graves u know, on both sides, too much for sane person liking (i do not consider myself too sane).

as for your despising ""them"": the underlying reason for your despise of iran is the fact they despise israel (that is how they got their devilish horns in international media) - think about that. you and ahmadenejad even both have the same punchline ""we don't hate people, just the enemy state""... only problem with that is that they often go together - people and their state.
 
and one more thing - do you hear yourself ""as a nation we despise iran"". you are talking for an entire nation of 30+million of ppl? cut the crap if you want me (or anybody else for that matter) to take you seriously.

back to the point - say you have a business partner and your joint business suffered from his mistake. it MAY be fixed if you work really hard together, but if you are to walk away in a protest, never to look back - business WILL surely collapse (same as you blow his head off, even if you don't get caught). that is what i'm trying to tell, you don't see logic in that?"

[kin-dza-dza 1986](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091341/)"
srbistan,"will check it out, sounds promising, thanks."
srbistan,"for a person who really don't give a shit you sure do have a pretty strong opinion... as i said, i do not know what would be the solution (thank you for your suggestions), but it seems the ""iran nuclear problem"" is blown out of proportion, which can only serve one purpose - yet another war.

iran is not totaly isolated, they do [business with western banks](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-16/hsbc-aided-money-laundering-by-iran-drug-cartels-probe-shows), or so i've heard. not to mention presidency over nonaligned movement, and probably there is more, but i do not know very much about that country.

please, don't give me that shit about killing their own people, what happened in SA just recently? where did those killed miners came from - mars? all governments are prepared to kill off it's citizens when they see it fit (that is called war u know - dying for a reason given by your government), only reasons differ from country to country. if you think wars and sanctions are going to solve anything, that is your prerogative, but i fail to see any proof of that in modern history, quite on contrary.

anyhow, my initial comment was on importance, or rather - unimportance, of what canada did, and what i think of that kind of actions, which is a personal opinion, not really relevant. i'm answering you out of pure politeness. if you want to get ""even"" with those ""evil iranians"" for whatever they did to YOU - just do it, i couldn't care less about religious freaks and brainwashed cannon fodder poking each other eyes out."
srbistan,"[threads 1984](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090163/) TV movie, but something really special and worth seeing.

[last man on earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090163/) remake is quite bearable too.

[war game 1965] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059894/) "
srbistan,"ghost dog, as most jarmusch movies, is a feast for the eyes and brains. vignettes are so good it makes me sad i can't frame them and put them on the wall : 
jesus winny u iced a broad! well, they wanted equality...(and he goes on bleeding to death) :D :D:D 

here are some of my favorites, hope you'll enjoy them as much as i did.

[une journee bien remlplie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069443/)
dark humor, thriller, action almost silent 

[Britannia Hospital (1982)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083694/) 
dark humor, social critic

[straight to hell 1987](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094048/) 

western story, modern setting, punk humor... (there are two versions of the movie, both are nice but i prefer 87. version)
[The Inglorious Bastards (1978) ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076584/)
(anti)war movie, action with a touch of drama and humor - immensely better then tarantino's version (nothing like it actually)

[The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/)
weird horror comedy, starring vincent price

[kikujiro](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199683/)
takeshi kitano's story of a kid wandering around with a vagabond drama, comedy..

[takeshi's](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478044/)
surrealist movie next to impossible to summarize, funny to watch with a great message

[izo 2004] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377079/)
complex japanese history/mythology transferred into movie - very hard to watch (people find it a bit disturbing), harder to figure out - but hell of a message IMO.

[Sukiyaki Western Django (2007)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906665/)
western story set in korea, based on ancient korean myth. beautiful, surrealist imagery starring tarantino

and yeah:
[man bites dog 1992.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103905/) nothing like this, before or after."
srbistan,"actually iran is lead by two people, its president and ayatolah (religious leader). first one is ahmadenejad who is (believe it or not) moderate and about the only thing that prevents iran going on a rampage. ""moderate"" as one can be in an non secular, islamic state high on their religion, that is.

when you have entire world threaten one country more extreme elements rise in that country, militarists and extremists of all kind. generally armed to the teath and eager to take power they tend to sweep aside those moderates.
what i'm trying to say is that by squeezing iran's balls world is helping militarisation of their society and fueling general feeling (amongst iranians) they need to be better armed to deter foreign threat. 
not that i have the solution (but i don't think kicking them in the pants would do the trick), only - i've seen militarisation of my own country in face of growing threat, which could be prevented if there was sincere will for dialogue."
srbistan,"joint slovenian and croatian GDP in former SFRY's was less then 20%. in serbia, from sixties to eighties there was an obligatory ""kosovan tax"", exclusively used for infrastructural projects on kosovo.
i can understand you sentiment against serbs, mass propaganda is a mighty stuff, but i suggest you do some research before presenting ""facts"", which are nothing more then popular belief, put it mildly. 

now, you didn't answer any of my previous questions, for instance - compared to kurdistan, was kosovo underdeveloped or not? how come USA didn't help kurds, what's wrong with their plea for independance? and, while we are talking genocide - what about those 1.5 million armenian victims turkey still pushes under the rug?"
srbistan,"how about this - i kick you out of your house, and let you sleep in a kennel in front of it, would you be satisfied with it or still feel robbed?"
srbistan,"in period after the WW2 kosovo was industrialized, electrified, free for all medical care was established and network of roads was built. before 1999. kosovo was far more developed then kurdistan now - if you are looking for comparison. 

man, albanians had university in their own language more then fifty years ago! american [equality rights bill](http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act/) was signed only four years prior to that, do you understand how progressive that was? 
comapred to that - do i need to remind you what turkey is doing with pro kurdish journalists in 21. century?  "
srbistan,"have you heard of western banks being investigated for breaking UN sanctions against iran, money laundering, financing arms trade? i don't think canadian withdrawal is of any real importance, apart from clear statement where canada stands, and more - how it stands, as a matter of style.

imagine this situation only amongst kids on a playground... you have that pale, tall (really strong) kid who supports local bully pushing around yet another of those brown-faced newcomers before fight even started, that's lame IMO. i do respect your personal oppinion that severence of ties with iran is a good thing, surely you have plenty of reasons.

here's what they (officially) say : [not a big deal](http://old.irna.ir/News/Politic/Lawmaker,-Severence-of-Tehran-Ottawa-ties-not-affecting-Iran_s-eco-political-fate/80316147)"
srbistan,"only difference - ottoman empire were invaders, kicked out of europe by united effort of many european nations, and serbs were living on kosovo since the ""great migration"" way before turkey even existed ;) 
if you're implying turkey - the campaign you are mentioning has already started, neo ottoman influence is rather obvious in albania, bosnia and kosovo. which is good as people around the world will  finally see your true colours. (it seems that head of operations for that illegal organs trade was, guess what, a turkish citizen!).

personally i think there are far more important divisions amongst people then by nation. say, those willing to accept the truth and those who don't, those who would stone women to death and those who would rather die trying to stop that.

nato has everything with kosovo, as a matter of fact - nato created kosovo, as it helped albanians to drive off serbs from their land. second, kosovo is not recognized country. it's only recognized by those who have direct interest in it or those who had theirs balls twisted hard enough by few mighty nations.

thank you for the kind words, please visit again, and again, and again. eat, drink, have fun, dance, laugh, speak any language you like... if i were to visit kosovo - it would probably be my last visit, think about it.

sincirerly
prick the barbarian"
srbistan,"last time serbs waited for some 400 years to get kosovo back from ottoman empire. it was long, bloody waiting let me tell you, but serbia prevailed and got back what belongs to it. how long nato exists 40, 50 -60 yrs? that is a mere lifetime - nothing compared to what most serbs are willing to do to protect this ""rich deposit of valuable minerals and important strategic position"".
people not living in balkans can hardly understand the importance of that piece of land, and i wouldn't dare starting to explain it here and now, but think jerusalem of orthodox christianity.

those who cooked this up knew this very well, and made ""nice"" little conflict to destabilize the region for the next few centuries in order to exploit it. what do you think will happen when balance of forces change in SE europe, and it's already changing? yet another round of horror, yet another round of arms contracts - that's what. sadly, albanians on kosovo tend to ignore that fact, believing turkey, NATO or any other foreign invasive force will protect them forever which can not be the case."
srbistan,"although what you have written can be easily proven wrong, just by looking at wikipedia, i won't waste my  time on it. 
i just want you to compare living conditions for ALL national groups prior to 1999. and now. what infrastructural projects have been started or completed in 13 yrs? what about the freedom of press, non albanian people being constantly exposed to terror attacks, schools being left without water, ambulances being forcefully closed... let's talk some truth on a personal level, ie - would you be relaxed knowing your sister wonders around kosovo in the night? no need to answer, really."
srbistan,"dude, there is no such thing as ""bosnian"". there are croats, muslims and serbs living in bosnia, which is a geographical term.  ""bosniak"" is the word invented by military propagandists, same as ""kosovan"" or ""collateral damage"". 

say, are you aware of the fact that serbs and croats are seeking independance from bosnian federation for years now? no way in hell they'll get it, and one might rightfully ask why not - if that is the legitimate right of constitutive nations? well if you figure out the answer - please let me know, as i couldn't.

try reading ""drina bridge"", historical novel by nobel prize winner ivo andric. it covers some 500 yrs of history, it is very interesting and it just might shed some more light on the matter for you, if you are interested.

i'm not that delusional to claim serbs are angels, far from it - what i'm trying to say is that serbs were victims of intensive media warfare and caught completely of guard, which resulted in many fair, honest and bright people being grossly misinformed and supporting actions they otherwise wouldn't. 
while i won't deny anybody right to be ignorant hater, i'm posting this for those willing to think twice and admit they were wrong, if that is the truth."
srbistan,"oh is that so? strange, this is what i remember from those days... 

 [nato bombs kosovo refugees](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/320204.stm)

furthermore you can do some research on birth defects and cancer rates on kosovo in period after bombing. you can hardly imagine what kind of damage has been done to kosovo, and it's being massacred even as we speak through illegal mining and logging ops, drugs, arms and slave trade... get real people - there is something very wrong going on in your name."
srbistan,"i agree prospect is rather grim. with a current state of affair, in a century or so USA shall have one more ""indian"" burden of shameful history to explain to it's youth, germany one more holocaust, france one more vichy.... wonder how serbs shall be called then, ""native kosovans"" maybe? 
i'm aware that morale is in short supply in modern world politics, but truth should be known - supporting kosovo independance is wrong, unfair and will cause more problems than it helped solve."
srbistan,"ethnic clensing is populist term like WMD used to explain and justify lots of things in just one sentance. civil war is horror beyond belief, which brings out the worst in people. thank god there are people oblivious to it, such as yourself. 
if you really believe that tactics called ""ethnic clensing"" were only used by one side, you either have a lot of history to learn, or whatever i say is pointless. "
srbistan,"it's very personal, i'm not even trying to hide it. then again, bredley manning story is very personal for me, even though i never met the man... but i try to stick to the facts. 

if you do some more research on this you'll see that this was more or less war of milan the fourth against bulgaria, an absolutist move for which an attempt on his life was made, and he had to abdicate few years later. ok, you proved me wrong with one conflict I wasn't aware of - does that change my point or makes it false?"
srbistan,"you are mostly right, only thing - serbs did not ""move them back"". here is short version of what happened: untill the late nineties serbia was part of communist frankenstein state called yugoslavia, which was led by dictator joseph broz tito.
he was the one who in 1972. changed constitution and gave then minuscule albanian minority rights that are reserved for constitutive nations only. this attracted albanians from albania (yugoslavia was something like ""the west"" of the eastern block, very nice to live in, in those days) who gradually pushed the serbs out wisely combining terrorist technique with a sad cry of the ""oppressed minority"" if someone would look.  the ""oppressed minority"" had it's own university, schools, radio and TV stations in their own language, and same treatment as anybody else.
final push was done by nato airforce, in 1999. when it was claimed that mass graves of albanians were found in village of Rachak on kosovo. needless to say that UN exhumation in Rachak haven't found anything, but by then most serbs were driven out of their homes. 

i can only ask people reading this to check number of serbian attacks against US/UK people after 1999. (and you bombed the fuck out of us, mind you...) and number of attacks done by kosovans, as they call them and lot of things will be much clearer. "
srbistan,"what quest of domination, please be more specific. i'm unaware of that, but can give you few facts about those poor serbs : 

-some 30 percent of entire serbian population died in WW1 fighting for that kosovo which was snatched away by big powers in 1999. against otoman turkey.
-60 percent of partisans killed in WW2 were serbs (that's more then 1.5 million people, and serbia never recovered from this) 

serbia exists since mediaeval times and NEVER waged aggressive war. judging serbian people for what one dictator did to it's neighbours during one decade of it's 800 years of history is either shallow, or malicious. what is more - same thing that happened in kosovo is now happening in syria, libya  etc. i understand it is hard to resist to the propaganda, but try. 
here is something you all should see - what western powers are letting go on in europe : [2:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edGaxOU4UAE)"
srbistan,"what kind of ties canada, that major player in the world politics, had to severe with iran in the first place? no more maple syrup in teheran? oh how sad - if that doesn't break them, nothing will.

seriously now, this is just a classic case of spinelessness on behalf of yet another USA-puppet government not really worth mentioning."
srbistan,"I have no particular love for the idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.

srbistan,"when will ""certain portion of the public"" realize that USSSR and Russia are two entirely different things? posting this is sure sign of ignorance, nothing funny with it, apart from OP trying to be smart and failing theatrically. 
USSSR was huge multicultural state, and although different nationalities live in Russia - it is still a national state.
and here's one more news for those think this is funny: Stalin was not Russian."
srbistan,"well what a noble thing this young Tomás de Torquemada's incarnation is doing... imagine all those deaf people turning blind too! 

now where is that white cane of mine mr. slave?"
srbistan,"reread through ""wake up"" glasses this actually sounds something like : 

former high ranking KGB officer, turned first elected tzar of russia, praises his adversary honesty... this should be at /r/funny..."
srbistan,"Madeleine Albright, US secretary of state at the time of nato aggression against serbia is now investing in kosovo telecommunication systems.

general wesley clarke, then in command of US forces, infamous for ordering lower ranking british general to attack russian troops stationed at pristina airport, (brit luckily told him to fuck off, as he is not willing to start WW3...) is now investing in ore mining operations.

need some more ulterior reasons? plenty of those, ranging from expected arms trade and global politics,  to free market expansion entrepreneurs at their best (as mentioned)... 

edit: secretary general -&gt; secretary of state "
srbistan,"sadly, but probably the very same thing that happened with christians on kosovo after NATO ""liberated"" it :

 [see 2:10 ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edGaxOU4UAE)"
srbistan,"ah, that's where bamby went... "
srbistan,"have no fear dustbunny, US will arm them, and they WILL pay for it all right... long time US strategy that provides turnover both for military economy and banking sector (as well as undertakers, both home and abroad, i must add) :

1 start a war

2 support poorly armed (there are always those who feel they should rule, and aren't doing so)

3 give them credits (desperate customers, will agree to almost anything)

4 sell guns for that credit (again, will agree to anything, even outdated scrap one is better of without)

5 make sure ""your"" side doesn't loose (no matter what they represent, no one will find out until it's too late)

6 exploit credit debt to control new formed government so they can order even more weapons

7 leave a seed of division amongst locals that can escalate into war at any time

8 move on to the neighbour, eyes facing east..."
srbistan,"cartoon had a voice over (when aired in my country) and it was unbearably irritating. acting was shallow and annoying beyond belief so much, that scene @ 2:28 eventually become sort of local meme (when translated into serbian).

i'm not saying it's a bad cartoon, nor that my disliking of it is in place, merely giving the reason why it got stuck in my mind. sorry if i sounded ""too smart"", wasn't my intention - glad to be of help. :)"

pozdrav svima (hi/bye all) :) "
srbistan,"please, let us not forget the bombing of former Yugoslavia in 1999. which started without UN permission, and was justified by existance of mass graves in kosovan village of rachak. after the war these ""mass graves"" at rachak were carefully examined by UN staff, and guess what - they were no traces of bodies, nor any proof there were people ever burried there.

as a result of ""merciful angel"", as NATO raids was named, spearheaded by USA&amp;UK some 2000 civilians were killed, many of them albanians (whom nato claimed they were trying to help). most native serbs were forced out from their homes, entire region was highly polluted with depleted uranium (resulting in increased cancer rates, birth defects and so on), and people are still being killed or crippled by airplane cluster bombs dropped by nato war planes.

there are well documented accusations that captives of kosovan liberation army were killed for organ transplants. investigation is pending, but UN takes it's time with it... a lot of time, as 13 years have passed, and most of evidence is destroyed by now, some even in the Hague court itself (source: chief prosecutor for the Hague tribunal Carla del Ponte)

basically, in an attempt to cover up for monika lewinsky blowjob USA&amp;UK helped commit genocide, but case against Clinton and Blair in front of Hague court was swiftly dismissed. blair is a suspected war criminal and he should answer for what he has done.

related: all of serbian government, military and paramilitary personal accused of war crimes were processed (either in serbia or netherland ) and most of them sentenced on lengthy (and well deserved) prison sentences, including their president at the time.

latest development from region is that US general W.Clark and Madeleine Albright, then secretary of state are investing in mining and telecom operations on kosovo, now almost serb-free, probably as a sign of gratitude for job well done. 

talking about justice in modern world... "
srbistan,"sorted, it was [the coast watcher 1989.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097715/)

although i see this is not very popular opinion i'll say again - this is the pattern repeating itself from afghanistan in 1980.'s, chechnya, bosnia, kosovo..."
srbistan,"glad to be of help, cheers!"
srbistan,"thank you, thank you, thank you SOOOO much! you really made my day, i'm jumping around laughing like a madman! been looking this for ages now. 

thank you once more - you sir are brilliant! "

srbistan,"did it, cheers"
srbistan,"""slaughtering his own people"" implies that rebel forces are syrian people fighting some kind of foreign mercs or preatorian guards, not the regular army comprised out of - other syrian people. many rebels are foreign fighters, as seen in numerous ""arab springs"", ""revolutions"" and ""upraisings"" so far. i'm pretty sure that there are far more mujahedins in rebel forces then foreign mercs in the regular army (haven't seen any proof they are recruiting, so far). if one fights under the command of a foreigner for an imported cause  - he does not exactly qualify as a part of ""syrian people"" IMO.
i understand fully that there are other reasons for rebels to fight besides being manipulated (ie. loss of a friends or family members, feeling of injustice being done...), but i try to focus on the roots of the conflict, not being distracted by civilian deaths, which are ""just"" horrible consequences."
srbistan,"""...slaughtering his own people..."" - and just what do you think who is fighting in the regular syrian army - martians? let me remind you that one of those ""slaughtered syrians"" was chechen leader's son. hell of a place to spend your holiday, unless he was on ""business"" there. 
syria is crawling with foreign mujahedins now days, just as bosnia was during nineties, afghanistan in the eighties, and libya and syria today.
one more thing, where (and how) did rebel forces (pardon me, unarmed protestors...) got their weapons, especially handheld AA&amp;AT launchers? who do you think organized them into fighting force capable of confronting an army? 
lastly, who ""invented"" al qaeda and osama bin laden in the first place during the afghan war in the eighties? resist to the propaganda and do some research of your own.
to be clear - i don't care for bashar al asad, but dig this - if his regime is to be replaced,  islamists will take his place, as there is no one else organized enough."
srbistan,"thank you very much for your help, i'll try this too.
what i do is look for this movie (there is one more i can't find, but won't bother with it) once in a few years, and since i started using reddit only lately i decided to give it a try here.

exact number of deaths, or objects used would be a spoiler and a shame to tell as it's a hilarious black comedy."
srbistan,"it's not about being afraid, don't get me wrong please. IMO people capable of thinking for themselves are like rare animals or plants that need to be preserved. like spicies one does not fully understand, nor can see it's use, but from which something good may come... you would probably do that for a plant, why not for yourself? "
srbistan,"yeah, yeah, i forgot the mantra - four legs good, two legs bad! :) 
your readiness to confront popular oppinion is admirable, but let us not forget about pvt. bredley manning (probably in process of forgetting his own name in solitary confinement by now) in the guantanamo hotel who did the same thing you did, only on a larger scale, or that ""damn rapist"" lying around ecuadorian embassy in the UK, like a thief in church in the mediaeval times.
people like you should take very good care of themselves, and not risk being iced by a wacko extremist from your own people. this may sound overexagerated, but as war lingers on there are more and more pissed off people from all sides - think about that moron killing sikhs for wearing tourbans and you'll get the pic. only thing those people hate more than ""enemy"" is ""THE TRAITOR""... they are stronger, so we gotta be smarter, justice and morality are very expensive goods these days. 

@CCBF - i think that mahat was just being sarcastic.. and please do not remind me of joyfull fact i probably still glow in the dark. as i was personally involved in futile attempts to fight back it wouldn't be fair to comment, but you can surely guess what i think of ""merciful angel"", as NATO engagement in serbia was poetically named.
edit: grammar is-&gt;are.."
srbistan,"unfortunately this is not a new tactic. similar stuff was used during the balkan wars in nineties, only they were throwing water heaters (boiler bombs) out of agricultural airplanes. heaters were packed with killing load, of course - sort of falling IED, only a bit bigger.. 
only good thing about this ""weapon"" is that it's carriers are slow and loud flying machines such as helis and propeller planes, which gives you some time to react (run for cover or try shooting it down with 2/30mm).

talking about war crimes - those bombs are still far less vile (no weapon is better than other, there is no good weapon..only more or less effective one) than white phosphorus NATO used in fallujah (iraq). white phosphorus usage as a weapon is banned by geneva convention, and case mentioned was well documented by the bbc."
srbistan,"can't agree, sorry. apple is booming - right? apple is outsourcing most of it's production to foxcon shenzen, right?
before intel sold it's production to lenovo, it used to outsource component production to them... however they were called at the time.
british telecom outsourced it's call services to india and is far from lost, as far as i can see.
USA olympic uniform was made in china, and most likely each and every piece of tech, and most of clothing you bought in last few years, not to mention generic electronic parts most machines are made out of.

anyhow, i mentioned outsourcing in a context of a scenario where cheap labour force pouring over western nations borders influences wages. to be precise - brings them down, unless there are limits on how low can they go - minimum wage. my point is simple, seen and proven - minimum wage is protection against modern age slavery."
srbistan,"i tried to give you fair chance of explaining yourself, hoping that through discussion you'll understand how wrong you are, but  it ain't worth it... i lived, read and have written about what you watched on you tube, dig that! 
won't waste a single character on you, as you clearly can't restrain yourself from insults in lack of arguments."
srbistan,"you didn't explain anything, but principles of discussion in general. thank you, but i'm familiar with those.

2 minimal wages are bad because one of many economy theorist says so.

first one is so personal and in my case untrue i didn't even bother answering it.
as for the second one, i gave you perfectly rational reason based on personal experience why i disagree, but you keep ""talking"" about me, instead about what i have said.. 

finally what arguments did you present for me to address, and did you bother reading or watching any of those links i've posted, or answering any my questions, which i thought were important? 
i was thought to respect people trying to discuss, and to think about what they have said, but it seems you're after the fight with a commie, which ain't gonna hapen. 

now, if you don't mind, please explain me in your own words how do you think inexistance of minimal wage would help working people. mind you - i'm not talking about the abstract term of ""the economy"", but normal, common working folks.
for me this issue is so simple and obvious that it's hard to believe someone serious doubts it, and that is the only reason i'm almost certain ur troll (this is not an insult, people do that - i don't mind at all). 

btw. 
no need to, nor chance of insulting me, i'm not allergic to thinking, quite the opposite.

have a nice night, gotta crash now :)"
srbistan,"since UR a native english speaker u must have understood what i've written, therefore i'm sure you are trying to troll me,  not very successfully though.. 
have a nice day :)"
srbistan,"i did, sorry you didn`t understand it. must be due to my poor language skills... i reccommended some light reading and watching in order to avoid explaining these simple, empirical facts - which now follow:

1. in overall financial turnover of a large company wages of the lower payed workers play insignificant portion. 
(think those poor suicidal buggers in apple shenzen factory, while apple is booming on stock market. if apple doubled or even trippled their wages it would still rock the stock)
2. if there is no limit on how low minimal wage would be, and you have large number of those in need of work employers can lower the wages as much as they want, up to the point where workers are barely kept alive.
(""decent living"" and ""bare survival"" differ by country and culture)
3. if workers refuse to work for any reason (strike, starvation, illnes, injury or else) - new will be brought in, willing to work under current or worse conditions. that is called slavery, not work.
4. i used to live in country where min. wage was strictly imposed, which is no longer the case. most people are practically turned into slaves which is justified with a simple phrase ""if you don't want it - plenty of those who will"".  
now, that is where ""no minimal wage"" ultimately leads to.

u can call me a commie bastard, but i've seen both doctrines in action - and it's very obvious what is better for the people. just check what outsourcing (fancy word  for going oversees for ""no min. wages"" workforce) did to USA, and check the facts. please do not C&amp;P neo-libertarian blabbermouths as they have motive for crime they are commiting - greed for money.

srbistan,"oh is that so? judging by your english, you are from ""the west"" (US,UK,AU...)?  say, imagine free labour migration worldwide, combined with no minimal wages... let's embrace neoliberalism in full! why outsource to china, let's import chinese (much love&amp;respect Chin people, this is just a figure of speech...).

how would you like to be swarmed by east-europeans (such as myself), asians or africans working for peanuts, compared to what you are used to and find yourself out of the job because what you would earn in that kind of world wouldn't be enough to support your current lifestyle (healthcare, schooling, house, car, vacation, food in a fridge...)?
there are bunch of books written on this subject (ie. grapes of wrath), but there is also a movie by mario monicelli called ""the organizer"" (1963) digesting most important aspects of it, from a human point of view.
find it, watch it, and rethink what you have written unless you are just kidding/trolling or actually employed by the charming twiggy we're talking about."
srbistan,"bwana, with a face like that, no wonder it seems everybody else is having loads of fun..."
srbistan,"jill dando ""killer"" was sentanced based on DNA evidence, for life. crucial evidence was organic particle that could be found in a gunpowder oxide, but it is also found in a bleech and washing powder (some kind of nitrite i believe, not sure really). quantity found was in traces, and it was found in a ""killers"" pockets. 
i used firearms quite a lot, but find it really difficult to aim from my trousers pocket, put mildly.
i still think guy was just an unfortunate looney, wrong place&amp;wrong time, who fell as a victim of a police/politicians need to silence public outcry.
there was that other case, when one unidentified woman was on the interpol's top list, for commiting hundreds of crimes, and she was busted in switzerland... problem was, she was a mere worker on a machine that feeds cotton-sticks into vials, used by interpol to gather DNA evidence, and somehow her DNA polluted number of vials.
altough DNA evidence seems like a magic wand to identify bad guys in reality is double edged sword, very prone to manipulations of all kind."
srbistan,"there was that whale that exploded while being carried through city in tawan in 2009.  it was a big, messy STINKING explosion, somebody even got hurt... plenty pics of it around.
"
srbistan,"SE europe, not a native english speaker if that is what ur asking. we have a phonetic alphabet, so spelling is something i never had to learn. is that a problem officer? 
doing my best though, if it'll make anybody feel better. 
if translation is needed, my point was : being cool for the money is not cool at all."
srbistan,"that looks like a piece from the last years john galliano ""buchenwald"" collection... "
srbistan,"IMA not an USA voter, nevertheless i`ve got three Q`s, if you wouldn`t mind :

1. how is bredley menning doing, brainwashed by now preasumably?
2. how many afghan civilians have died since you got your nobel peace prize?
3. is USA going to ask sweeden to extradite julian asange?

now please show us some guts and answer this, thank you :)"
srbistan,"f*ck i hate ""funny"", ""cool"" etc money grabbing corporations and their success in invading other people fun. worst of all - people are falling for it, and liking it in a process."
